	Abstract = {This review is focused on tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity with gravitational waves that are detectable by ground-based interferometers and pulsar-timing experiments. Einstein's theory has been greatly constrained in the quasi-linear, quasi-stationary regime, where gravity is weak and velocities are small. Gravitational waves will allow us to probe a complimentary, yet previously unexplored regime: the non-linear and dynamical strong-field regime. Such a regime is, for example, applicable to compact binaries coalescing, where characteristic velocities can reach fifty percent the speed of light and gravitational fields are large and dynamical. This review begins with the theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational-wave observables of modified gravity theories. The review continues with a brief description of the detectors, including both gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar-timing arrays, leading to a discussion of the data analysis formalism that is applicable for such tests. The review ends with a discussion of gravitational-wave tests for compact binary systems.},

	Abstract = {In the past decade, weak gravitational lensing has become an important tool  in the study of the universe at the largest scale, giving insights into the  distribution of dark matter, the expansion of the universe, and the nature  of dark energy. This thesis research explores several applications  of Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve (KL) analysis to speed and improve the comparison of  weak lensing shear catalogs to theory in order to constrain cosmological   parameters in current and future lensing  surveys. This work addresses three related aspects of weak lensing analysis: Three-dimensional Tomographic Mapping:  (Based on work published in Vanderplas et al 2011) We explore a new fast approach to three-dimensional mass mapping in weak lensing surveys.  The KL approach uses a KL-based filtering of the shear signal to reconstruct mass structures on the line-of-sight, and provides a unified framework to evaluate the efficacy of linear reconstruction techniques.  We find that the KL-based filtering leads to near-optimal angular resolution, and computation times which are faster than previous approaches.  We also use the KL formalism to show that linear non-parametric reconstruction methods are fundamentally limited in their ability to resolve lens redshifts. Shear Peak Statistics with Incomplete Data:  (Based on work published in Vanderplas et al 2012) We explore the use of KL eigenmodes for interpolation across masked regions in observed shear maps.  Mass mapping is an inherently non-local calculation, meaning gaps in the data can have a significant effect on the properties of the derived mass map.  Our KL mapping procedure leads to improvements in the recovery of detailed statistics of peaks in the mass map, which holds promise of improved cosmological constraints based on such studies. Two-point parameter estimation with KL modes:  The power spectrum of the observed shear can yield powerful cosmological constraints.  Incomplete survey sky coverage, however, can lead to mixing of power between Fourier modes, and obfuscate the cosmologically sensitive signal.  We show that KL can be used to derive an alternate orthonormal basis for the problem which avoids mode-mixing and allows a convenient formalism for cosmological likelihood computations.  Cosmological constraints derived using this method are shown to be competitive with those from the more conventional correlation function approach.  We also discuss several aspects of the KL approach which will allow improved handling of correlated errors and redshift information in future surveys.},

@article{takada:2013a,
	Abstract = {We provide a simple, unified approach to describing the impact of super-sample covariance, or beat coupling, on power spectrum estimation in a finite-volume survey. For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. The deeply nonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. We show that all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the density field such as weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations. It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

@article{taburet:2011,
	Abstract = {If dark energy introduces an acceleration in the universal expansion then large-scale gravitational potential wells should be shrinking, causing a blueshift in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons that cross such structures [integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect]. Galaxy clusters are known to probe those potential wells. In these objects, CMB photons also experience inverse Compton scattering off the hot electrons of the intracluster medium and this results in a distortion with a characteristic spectral signature of the CMB spectrum [the so-called thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect]. Since both the ISW and the tSZ effects take place in the same potential wells, they must be spatially correlated. We present how this cross-ISW-tSZ signal can be detected in a CMB data contained way by using the frequency dependence of the tSZ effect in multifrequency CMB experiments like Planck, without requiring the use of external large-scale structure tracers data. We find that by masking low-redshift clusters, the shot noise level decreases significantly, boosting the signal-to-noise ratio of the ISW-tSZ cross-correlation. Nevertheless, in a more realistic case in which we only mask the clusters that could be detected by Planck, detection of the ISW-tSZ cross-signal is expected to reach only low significance (1.5sigma) unless external cluster catalogues are used to mask the tSZ signal coming from lower mass clusters at low z that do not significantly contribute to the signal but to the shot noise. We also find that galactic and extragalactic dust residuals must be kept at or below the level of ˜0.04 (muK)2 at l= 10, a limit that is a factor of a few below Planck's expectations for foreground subtraction. If this is achieved, CMB observations of the ISW-tSZ cross-correlation should also provide an independent probe for the existence of dark energy and the amplitude of density perturbations.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the relation between the regularized multi-propagator method, called "Reg PT," and the standard perturbation theory. Reg PT is one of the most successful models to describe nonlinear evolution of dark matter fluctuations. However, Reg PT is a mathematically unproven interpolation formula between the large-scale solution calculated by the standard perturbation theory and the limiting solution in the small scale calculated by the multi-point propagator method. In this paper, we give an alternative explanation for Reg PT in the context of the standard perturbation theory, showing that Reg PT does not ever have more effective information on nonlinear matter evolution than the standard perturbation theory. In other words, the solutions of the standard perturbation theory reproduce the results of N-body simulations better than those of Reg PT, especially at the high-k region. This fact means that the standard perturbation theory at the two-loop level is still one of the best predictions of the nonlinear power spectrum to date. Nevertheless, the standard perturbation theory has not been preferred because of the divergent behavior of the solution at small scales. To solve this problem, we also propose a modified standard perturbation theory which avoids the divergence.},

A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we summarize and extent previous work of the `halo finder comparison project': we investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent, we decipher and discuss differences in halo-finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass and the peak value of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes stems from the distinct particle collection methods and - to a minor extent - the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing and observables in general.},

	Abstract = {The stacking of cosmic microwave background (CMB) patches has been recently used to detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (iSW). When focusing on the locations of superstructures identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Granett et al. (2008a, ApJ, 683, L99, Gr08) found a signal with strong significance and an amplitude reportedly higher than expected within the LambdaCDM paradigm. We revisit the analysis using our own robust protocol, and extend the study to the two most recent and largest catalogues of voids publicly available. We quantify and subtract the level of foreground contamination in the stacked images and determine the contribution on the largest angular scales from the first multipoles of the CMB. We obtain the radial temperature and photometry profiles from the stacked images. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we computed the statistical significance of the profiles for each catalogue and identified the angular scale at which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is maximum. We essentially confirm the signal detection reported by Gr08, but for the other two catalogues, a rescaling of the voids to the same size on the stacked image is needed to find any significant signal (with a maximum at ~2.4sigma). This procedure reveals that the photometry peaks at unexpectedly large angles in the case of the Gr08 voids, in contrast to voids from other catalogues. Conversely, the photometry profiles derived from the stacked voids of these other catalogues contain small central hot spots of uncertain origin. We also stress the importance of a posteriori selection effects that might arise when intending to increase the S/N, and we discuss the possible impact of void overlap and alignment effects. We argue that the interpretation in terms of an iSW effect of any detected signal via the stacking method is far from obvious.},

We show here that uncertainties in the elements of the covariance matrix propagate directly to increased uncertainties in cosmological parameters. When the covariance matrix is determined by simulations, the resulting variance of the each parameter increases by a factor of order 1+Nb/Ns, where Nb is the number of bands in the measurement and Ns is the number of simulations.},

	Abstract = {A new computational scheme for the nonlinear cosmological matter power spectrum (PS) is presented. Our method is based on evolution equations in time, which can be cast in a form extremely convenient for fast numerical evaluations. A nonlinear PS is obtained in a time comparable to that needed for a simple 1-loop computation, and the numerical implementation is very simple. Our results agree with N-body simulations at the percent level in the BAO range of scales, and at the few-percent level up to k simeq 1 h/Mpc at zgsim0.5, thereby opening the possibility of applying this tool to scales interesting for weak lensing. We clarify the approximations inherent to this approach as well as its relations to previous ones, such as the Time Renormalization Group, and the multi-point propagator expansion. We discuss possible lines of improvements of the method and its intrinsic limitations by multi streaming at small scales and low redshifts.},

@article{rasera:2014,
	Abstract = {We investigate the non-linear evolution of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the low-redshift matter power spectrum from the DEUS-FUR LambdaCDM model simulation. This is the first cosmological N-body simulation encompassing the full observable cosmic volume, thus allowing cosmic-variance limited predictions at BAO scales. We control the effect of numerical systematic errors using a series of large-volume high-resolution simulations. The combined analysis allows us to measure the matter power spectrum between z = 0 and 1 to 1 per cent over the entire BAO range, 0.03 < k[h Mpc-1] < 0.3, in bins of size Deltak/k ≲ 1 per cent. We define the BAO with respect to a non-linearly evolved wiggle-free spectrum and determine the characteristics of the BAO without recurring to extrapolation from global fitting functions. We quantify the effects of non-linearities on the position and amplitude of the BAO extrema, and the coupling to the broad-band slope of the power spectrum. We use these estimates to test non-linear predictions from semi-analytical models. Quite remarkably from the analysis of the redshift evolution of BAO we find that the second dip and third peak remains unaltered by non-linear effects. Furthermore, we find that the square of the damping factor and the shift of the position of BAO extrema scale to good approximation as the square of the growth factor, in agreement with expectations from perturbation theory. This confirms the idea that, besides cosmic distances, an accurate measurement of BAO at different redshifts can directly probe the growth of cosmic structures.},

	Abstract = {We measure the cross-correlation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing convergence maps derived from Atacama Cosmology Telescope data with galaxy lensing convergence maps as measured by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey. The CMB-galaxy lensing cross power spectrum is measured for the first time with a significance of 4.2 sigma , which corresponds to a 12% constraint on the amplitude of density fluctuations at redshifts ˜0.9 . With upcoming improved lensing data, this novel type of measurement will become a powerful cosmological probe, providing a precise measurement of the mass distribution at intermediate redshifts and serving as a calibrator for systematic biases in weak lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {The quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatly accelerated in recent years, and further leaps forward will be facilitated by imminent projects. These will enable us to map the evolution of dark and baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these fluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to several pieces of fundamental physics: the primordial perturbations generated by GUT-scale physics; neutrino masses and interactions; the nature of dark matter and dark energy. We focus on the last of these here: the ways that combining probes of growth with those of the cosmic expansion such as distance-redshift relations will pin down the mechanism driving the acceleration of the Universe.  One way to explain the acceleration of the Universe is invoke dark energy parameterized by an equation of state w. Distance measurements provide one set of constraints on w, but dark energy also affects how rapidly structure grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth of structure. Upcoming surveys are therefore designed to probe w with direct observations of the distance scale and the growth of structure, each complementing the other on systematic errors and constraints on dark energy. A consistent set of results will greatly increase the reliability of the final answer.  Another possibility is that there is no dark energy, but that General Relativity does not describe the laws of physics accurately on large scales. While the properties of gravity have been measured with exquisite precision at stellar system scales and densities, within our solar system and by binary pulsar systems, its properties in different environments are poorly constrained. To fully understand if General Relativity is the complete theory of gravity we must test gravity across a spectrum of scales and densities. Rapid developments in gravitational wave astronomy and numerical relativity are directed at testing gravity in the high curvature, high density regime. Cosmological evolution provides a polar opposite test bed, probing how gravity behaves in the lowest curvature, low density environments.  There are a number of different implementations of astrophysically relevant modifications of gravity. Generically, the models are able to reproduce the distance measurements while at the same time altering the growth of structure. In particular, as detailed below, the Poisson equation relating over-densities to gravitational potentials is altered, and the potential that determines the geodesics of relativistic particles (such as photons) differs from the potential that determines the motion of non-relativistic particles. Upcoming surveys will exploit these differences to determine whether the acceleration of the Universe is due to dark energy or to modified gravity.  To realize this potential, both wide field imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects including DES, eBOSS, DESI, PFS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST are in line to map more than a 1000 cubic-billion-light-year volume of the Universe. These will map the cosmic structure growth rate to 1% in the redshift range 0 < z < 2 , over the last 3/4 of the age of the Universe.},

	Abstract = {This document presents the results from the Distances subgroup of the Cosmic Frontier Community Planning Study (Snowmass 2013). We summarize the current state of the field as well as future prospects and challenges. In addition to the established probes using Type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations, we also consider prospective methods based on clusters, active galactic nuclei, gravitational wave sirens and strong lensing time delays.  We note that these three elements together make a comprehensive DOE SN program, with a well- sequenced combination of R&D, construction, operations and analysis projects. The DOE SN researchers will be involved in several of these at any given time, since the precision SN cosmology measurement requires an in-depth understanding and use of SN data from all the redshift ranges simultaneously.  A future Stage IV space-based SNe project would be the simplest way to match, at high redshift, these precision measurements of Type Ia supernovae at low redshift -measurements needed to provide the same systematics control over the entire redshift range from z ~ 0.01 to z ~ 2 . With modest investments in spectroscopic capabilities and a small fraction of mission time, WFIRST-AFTA could be upgraded [Editor's note: and has been upgraded in the current baseline; see Footnote2] to become this project, and would be complementary to the lensing programs of LSST/EUCLID. However, given the timescales and many difficulties of a space mission, there is now a need to explore vigorously a ground-based alternative to fill this important missing element in the DOE program. In particular, an R&D effort to explore the potential of novel ground-based techniques, combining near-IR technology with OH sky-line suppression, could make it possible to accomplish the precision measurements for SNe from SCP, DES, and LSST, complementing and strengthening these currently approved DOE projects.},

	Abstract = {Fluctuations in the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe each contain clues about the nature of the earliest moments of time. The next generation of CMB and large-scale structure (LSS) experiments are poised to test the leading paradigm for these earliest moments-the theory of cosmic inflation-and to detect the imprints of the inflationary epoch, thereby dramatically increasing our understanding of fundamental physics and the early universe. A future CMB experiment with sufficient angular resolution and frequency coverage that surveys at least 1% of the sky to a depth of 1 uK-arcmin can deliver a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio that will either result in a 5 sigma measurement of the energy scale of inflation or rule out all large-field inflation models, even in the presence of foregrounds and the gravitational lensing B-mode signal. LSS experiments, particularly spectroscopic surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, will complement the CMB effort by improving current constraints on running of the spectral index by up to a factor of four, improving constraints on curvature by a factor of ten, and providing non-Gaussianity constraints that are competitive with the current CMB bounds.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (l ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LambdaCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be theta* = (1.04147 $\pm$ 0.00062) × 10-2, Omegabh2 = 0.02205 $\pm$ 0.00028, Omegach2 = 0.1199 $\pm$ 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 $\pm$ 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 $\pm$ 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omegam = 0.315 $\pm$ 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter LambdaCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter LambdaCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 $\pm$ 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter LambdaCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ l ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

@article{raccanelli:2015,
	Abstract = {The Planck CMB experiment has delivered the best constraints so far on primordial non-Gaussianity, ruling out early-Universe models of inflation that generate large non-Gaussianity. Although small improvements in the CMB constraints are expected, the next frontier of precision will come from future large-scale surveys of the galaxy distribution. The advantage of such surveys is that they can measure many more modes than the CMB---in particular, forthcoming radio surveys with the Square Kilometre Array will cover huge volumes. Radio continuum surveys deliver the largest volumes, but with the disadvantage of no redshift information. In order to mitigate this, we use two additional observables. First, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect---the cross-correlation of the radio number counts with the CMB temperature anisotropies---helps to reduce systematics on the large scales that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity. Second, optical data allows for cross-identification in order to gain some redshift information. We show that, while the single redshift bin case can provide a sigma(fNL) ~ 20, and is therefore not competitive with current and future constraints on non-Gaussianity, a tomographic analysis could improve the constraints by an order of magnitude, even with only two redshift bins. A huge improvement is provided by the addition of high-redshift sources, so having cross-ID for high-z galaxies and an even higher-z radio tail is key to enabling very precise measurements of fNL. We use Fisher matrix forecasts to predict the constraining power in the case of no redshift information and the case where cross-ID allows a tomographic analysis, and we show that the constraints do not improve much with 3 or more bins. Our results show that SKA continuum surveys could provide constraints competitive with CMB and forthcoming optical surveys, potentially allowing a measurement of sigma(fNL) ~ 1 to be made. Moreover, these measurements would act as a useful check of results obtained with other probes at other redshift ranges with other methods.},

	Abstract = {We use the WISE-2MASS infrared galaxy catalogue matched with Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) galaxies to search for a supervoid in the direction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) cold spot (CS). Our imaging catalogue has median redshift z ~= 0.14, and we obtain photometric redshifts from PS1 optical colours to create a tomographic map of the galaxy distribution. The radial profile centred on the CS shows a large low-density region, extending over tens of degrees. Motivated by previous CMB results, we test for underdensities within two angular radii, 5$\,^{\circ}$, and 15$\,^{\circ}$. The counts in photometric redshift bins show significantly low densities at high detection significance, ≳5sigma and ≳6sigma, respectively, for the two fiducial radii. The line-of-sight position of the deepest region of the void is z ~= 0.15-0.25. Our data, combined with an earlier measurement by Granett, Szapudi & Neyrinck, are consistent with a large Rvoid = (220 $\pm$ 50) h-1 Mpc supervoid with deltam ~= -0.14 $\pm$ 0.04 centred at z = 0.22 $\pm$ 0.03. Such a supervoid, constituting at least a ~=3.3sigma fluctuation in a Gaussian distribution of the Lambda cold dark matter model, is a plausible cause for the CS.},

@article{finelli:2016,
	Abstract = {The Cold Spot (CS) is a clear feature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB); it could be of primordial origin, or caused by a intervening structure along the line of sight. We identified a large projected underdensity in the recently constructed WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared galaxy catalogue aligned with the CS direction at (l, b) ≈ (209$\,^{\circ}$, -57$\,^{\circ}$). It has an angular size of tens of degrees, and shows a ˜20 per cent galaxy underdensity in the centre. Moreover, we find another large underdensity in the projected WISE-2MASS galaxy map at (l, b) ≈ (101$\,^{\circ}$, 46$\,^{\circ}$) (hereafter Draco supervoid), also aligned with a CMB decrement, although less significant than that of the CS direction. Motivated by these findings, we develop spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) compensated void models to explain the observed CMB decrements with these two underdensities, or `supervoids'. Within our perturbative treatment of the LTB voids, we find that the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Riess-Sciama effects due to the Draco supervoid can account for the CMB decrement observed in the same direction. On the contrary, the extremely deep CMB decrement in the CS direction is more difficult to explain by the presence of the CS supervoid only. Nevertheless, the probability of a random alignment between the CS and the corresponding supervoid is disfavoured, and thus its contribution as a secondary anisotropy cannot be neglected. We comment on how the approximations used in this paper, in particular the assumption of spherical symmetry, could change quantitatively our conclusions and might provide a better explanation for the CMB CS.},

	Abstract = {The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect measures the decay of the gravitational potential due to cosmic acceleration and is thus a direct probe of dark energy. In some of the earlier studies, the amplitude of the ISW effect was found to be in tension with the predictions of the standard Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM ) model. We measure the cross power of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission with cosmic microwave background temperature data from WMAP9 in order to provide an independent measurement of the ISW amplitude. Cross-correlations with the recently released Planck lensing potential maps are used to calibrate the bias and contamination fraction of the sources, thus avoiding systematic effects that could be present when using autospectra to measure bias. We find an amplitude of the cross power of A =1.24 $\pm$0.47 from the galaxies and A =0.88 $\pm$0.74 from the AGN, fully consistent with the Lambda CDM prediction of A =1 . The ISW measurement signal-to-noise ratio is 2.7 and 1.2 respectively. Comparing the amplitudes of the Galaxy and AGN cross-correlations, which arise from different redshifts, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in dark energy properties, consistent with a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

	Abstract = {This is a report on the status and prospects of the quantification of neutrino properties through the cosmological neutrino background for the Cosmic Frontier of the Division of Particles and Fields Community Summer Study long-term planning exercise. Experiments planned and underway are prepared to study the cosmological neutrino background in detail via its influence on distance-redshift relations and the growth of structure. The program for the next decade described in this document, including upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys eBOSS and DESI and a new Stage-IV CMB polarization experiment CMB-S4, will achieve sigma (sigmamnu)  = 16 meV and sigma (Neff)  = 0.020. Such a mass measurement will produce a high significance detection of non-zero sigmamnu , whose lower bound derived from atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation data is about 58 meV. If neutrinos have a minimal normal mass hierarchy, this measurement will definitively rule out the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, shedding light on one of the most puzzling aspects of the Standard Model of particle physics - the origin of mass. This precise a measurement of Neff will allow for high sensitivity to any light and dark degrees of freedom produced in the big bang and a precision test of the standard cosmological model prediction that Neff = 3.046 .},

@article{de-zotti:2015,
	Abstract = {We discuss the potential of a next generation space-borne CMB experiment for studies of extragalactic sources with reference to COrE+, a project submitted to ESA in response to the call for a Medium-size mission (M4). We consider three possible options for the telescope size: 1 m, 1.5 m and 2 m (although the last option is probably impractical, given the M4 boundary conditions). The proposed instrument will be far more sensitive than Planck and will have a diffraction-limited angular resolution. These properties imply that even the 1 m telescope option will perform substantially better than Planck for studies of extragalactic sources. The source detection limits as a function of frequency have been estimated by means of realistic simulations taking into account all the relevant foregrounds. Predictions for the various classes of extragalactic sources are based on up-to-date models. The most significant improvements over Planck results are presented for each option. COrE+ will provide much larger samples of truly local star-forming galaxies (by about a factor of 8 for the 1 m telescope, of 17 for 1.5 m, of 30 for 2 m), making possible analyses of the properties of galaxies (luminosity functions, dust mass functions, star formation rate functions, dust temperature distributions, etc.) across the Hubble sequence. Even more interestingly, COrE+ will detect, at |b| > 30$\,^{\circ}$, thousands of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies (about 2,000, 6,000 and 13,000 for the 1 m, 1.5 m and 2 m options, respectively). Such large samples are of extraordinary astrophysical and cosmological value in many fields. Moreover, COrE+ high frequency maps will be optimally suited to pick up proto-clusters of dusty galaxies, i.e. to investigate the evolution of large scale structure at larger redshifts than can be reached by other means. Thanks to its high sensitivity COrE+ will also yield a spectacular advance in the blind detection of extragalactic sources in polarization: we expect that it will detect up to a factor of 40 (1 m option) or of 160 (1.5 m option) more radio sources than can be detected by Planck and, for the first time, from several tens (1 m option) to a few hundreds (1.5 m option) of star forming galaxies. This will open a new window for studies of the global properties of magnetic fields in star forming galaxies and of their relationships with star formation rates.},

	Abstract = {A detection of excess cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization on large scales allows the possibility of measuring not only the amplitude of these fluctuations but also their scale dependence, which can be parametrized as the tensor tilt nT. Measurements of this scale dependence will be hindered by the secondary B-mode polarization anisotropy induced by gravitational lensing. Fortunately, these contaminating B modes can be estimated and removed with a sufficiently good estimate of the intervening gravitational potential and a good map of CMB E-mode polarization. We present forecasts for how well these gravitational lensing B modes can be removed, assuming that the lensing potential can be estimated either internally from CMB data or using maps of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) as a tracer. We find that CIB maps are as effective as CMB maps for delensing at the noise levels of the current generation of CMB experiments, while the CMB maps themselves will ultimately be best for delensing at polarization noise below {{{Delta }}}{{P}} = 1 muK arcmin. At this sensitivity level, CMB delensing will be able to measure nT to an accuracy of 0.02 or better, which corresponds to the tensor tilt predicted by the consistency relation for single-field slow-roll models of inflation with r = 0.2. However, CIB-based delensing will not be sufficient for constraining nT in simple inflationary models.},

@article{sherwin:2015,
	Abstract = {As confusion with lensing B modes begins to limit experiments that search for primordial B-mode polarization, robust methods for delensing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization sky are becoming increasingly important. We investigate in detail the possibility of delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background (CIB), emission from dusty star-forming galaxies that is an excellent tracer of the CMB lensing signal, in order to improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r . We find that the maps of the CIB, such as current Planck satellite maps at 545 GHz, can be used to remove more than half of the lensing B-mode power. Calculating optimal combinations of different large-scale-structure tracers for delensing, we find that coadding CIB data and external arcminute-resolution CMB lensing reconstruction can lead to significant additional improvements in delensing performance. We investigate whether measurement uncertainty in the CIB power spectra will degrade the delensing performance if no model of the CIB spectra is assumed, and instead the CIB power spectra are marginalized over, when constraining r . We find that such uncertainty does not significantly affect B-mode surveys smaller than a few thousand degrees. Even for larger surveys it causes only a moderate reduction in CIB delensing performance, especially if the surveys have high (arcminute) resolution, which allows self calibration of the delensing procedure. Though further work on the impact of foreground residuals is required, our overall conclusions for delensing with current CIB data are optimistic: this delensing method can tighten constraints on r by a factor up to ≈2.2 , and by a factor up to ≈4 when combined with external lensing reconstruction for ≈3 mu K -arcmin noise, without requiring the modeling of CIB properties. CIB delensing is thus a promising method for the upcoming generation of CMB polarization surveys.},

	Abstract = {The quest for a B-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires the characterization of foreground polarization from Galactic dust. We present a statistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 GHz Planck Stokes maps at high Galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as a polarized foreground to the CMB. We filter the intensity and polarization maps to isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetry between E-modes and B-modes is observed. Using the Smoothed Hessian Major Axis Filament Finder (SMAFF), we identify 259 filaments at high Galactic latitude, with lengths larger or equal to 2$\,^{\circ}$ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for a typical distance of 100 pc). Thesefilaments show a preferred orientation parallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derived from their polarization angles. We present mean maps of the filaments in Stokes I, Q, U, E, and B, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align the orientations of the filaments. Combining the stacked images and the histogram of relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of the filaments to be 11%. Furthermore, we show that the correlation between the filaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the E and B asymmetry and the ClTE/ClEE ratio, reported in the power spectra analysis of the Planck353 GHz polarization maps. Future models of the dust foreground for CMB polarization studies will need to take into account the observed correlation between the dust polarization and the structure of interstellar matter.},

	Abstract = {We describe a method for measuring the integrated Comptonization (Y SZ) of clusters of galaxies from measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in multiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxy clusters detected in the South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit a beta-model source profile and integrate Y SZ within an angular aperture on the sky. In simulated observations of an SPT-like survey that include cosmic microwave background anisotropy, point sources, and atmospheric and instrumental noise at typical SPT-SZ survey levels, we show that we can accurately recover beta-model parameters for inputted clusters. We measure Y SZ for simulated semi-analytic clusters and find that Y SZ is most accurately determined in an angular aperture comparable to the SPT beam size. We demonstrate the utility of this method to measure Y SZ and to constrain mass scaling relations using X-ray mass estimates for a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the SPT-SZ survey. Measuring Y SZ within a 0.'75 radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21% $\pm$ 11% in Y SZ at a fixed mass. Measuring Y SZ within a 0.3 Mpc projected radius (equivalent to 0.'75 at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatter of 26% $\pm$ 9%. Prior to this study, the SPT observable found to have the lowest scatter with mass was cluster detection significance. We demonstrate, from both simulations and SPT observed clusters that Y SZ measured within an aperture comparable to the SPT beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with cluster mass, to SPT cluster detection significance.},

	Abstract = {We present a measurement of the B-mode polarization power spectrum (the BB spectrum) from 100 {{deg}}2 of sky observed with SPTpol, a polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole Telescope. The observations used in this work were taken during 2012 and early 2013 and include data in spectral bands centered at 95 and 150 GHz. We report the BB spectrum in five bins in multipole space, spanning the range 300<=slant {\ell }<=slant 2300, and for three spectral combinations: 95 GHz × 95 GHz, 95 GHz × 150 GHz, and 150 GHz × 150 GHz. We subtract small (<0.5sigma in units of statistical uncertainty) biases from these spectra and account for the uncertainty in those biases. The resulting power spectra are inconsistent with zero power but consistent with predictions for the BB spectrum arising from the gravitational lensing of E-mode polarization. If we assume no other source of BB power besides lensed B modes, we determine a preference for lensed B modes of 4.9sigma. After marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, namely, polarized emission from galactic dust and extragalactic sources, this significance is 4.3sigma. Fitting for a single parameter, {A}{lens}, that multiplies the predicted lensed B-mode spectrum, and marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, we find {A}{lens}=1.08+/- 0.26, indicating that our measured spectra are consistent with the signal expected from gravitational lensing. The data presented here provide the best measurement to date of the B-mode power spectrum on these angular scales.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsic alignment (IA) of source galaxies is one of the major astrophysical systematics for weak lensing surveys. Several IA models have been proposed and their impact on cosmological constraints has been examined using the Fisher information matrix in conjunction with approximate, Gaussian covariances. This paper presents the first forecasts of the impact of IA on cosmic shear measurements for future surveys using simulated likelihood analyses and covariances that include higher order moments of the density field. We consider a range of possible IA scenarios and test mitigation schemes which parametrize IA by the fraction of red galaxies, normalization, luminosity and redshift dependence of the IA signal. Compared to previous studies, we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models if IA is ignored in the analysis. The amplitude and significance of these biases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical uncertainties), luminosity function and IA scenario. Due to its small statistical errors and relatively shallow depth, Euclid is significantly impacted by IA. Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) benefit from increased survey depth, while larger statistical errors for Dark Energy Survey (DES) decrease IA's relative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme removes parameter biases for DES, LSST and WFIRST even if the shape of the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for Euclid requires more prior information. We explore several alternative IA mitigation strategies for Euclid; in the absence of alignment of blue galaxies we recommend the exclusion of red (IA-contaminated) galaxies in cosmic shear analyses.},

@article{di-valentino:2015,
	Abstract = {Cosmological constraints are usually derived under the assumption of a six-parameter Lambda CDM theoretical framework or simple one-parameter extensions. In this paper we present, for the first time, cosmological constraints in a significantly extended scenario, varying up to 12 cosmological parameters simultaneously, including the sum of neutrino masses, the neutrino effective number, the dark energy equation of state, the gravitational wave background and the running of the spectral index of primordial perturbations. Using the latest Planck 2015 data release (with polarization), we found no significant indication for extensions to the standard Lambda CDM scenario, with the notable exception of the angular power spectrum lensing amplitude, Alens , which is larger than the expected value at more than 2 standard deviations, even when combining the Planck data with BAO and supernovae type Ia external data sets. In our extended cosmological framework, we find that a combined Planck+BAO analysis constrains the value of the rms density fluctuation parameter to sigma8=0.781-0.063+0.065 at 95 % C.L., helping to relieve the possible tensions with the CFHTlenS cosmic shear survey. We also find a lower value for the reionization optical depth tau =0.058-0.043+0.040 at 95 % C.L. with respect to the one derived under the assumption of Lambda CDM . The scalar spectral index nS is now compatible with a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum to within 2.5 standard deviations. Combining the Planck data set with the Hubble Space Telescope prior on the Hubble constant provides a value for the equation of state w <-1 at more than 2 standard deviations, while the neutrino effective number is fully compatible with the expectations of the standard three neutrino framework.},

	Abstract = {Future cosmological measurements should enable the sum of neutrino masses to be determined indirectly through their effects on the expansion rate of the Universe and the clustering of matter. We consider prospects for the gravitationally lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the galaxy distribution, examining how the projected uncertainty of ≈15 meV on the neutrino mass sum (a 4 sigma detection of the minimal mass) might be reached over the next decade. The current 1 sigma uncertainty of ≈103 meV (Planck-2015 +BAO -15 ) will be improved by upcoming "Stage-3" (S3) CMB experiments (S 3 +BAO -15 : 44 meV ), then upcoming BAO measurements (S 3 +DESI : 22 meV ), and planned next-generation "Stage 4" (S4) CMB experiments (S 4 +DESI : 15 - 19 meV , depending on angular range). An improved optical depth measurement is important: the projected neutrino mass uncertainty increases to 26 meV if S4 is limited to l>20 and combined with current large-scale polarization data. Looking beyond Lambda CDM , including curvature uncertainty increases the forecast mass error by ≈50 % for S 4 +DESI , and more than doubles the error with a two-parameter dark-energy equation of state. Complementary low-redshift probes including galaxy lensing will play a role in distinguishing between massive neutrinos and a departure from a w =-1 , flat geometry.},

	Abstract = {Delensing is an increasingly important technique to reverse the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and thus reveal primordial signals the lensing may obscure. We present a first demonstration of delensing on Planck temperature maps using the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Reversing the lensing deflections in Planck CMB temperature maps using a linear combination of the 545 and 857 GHz maps as a lensing tracer, we find that the lensing effects in the temperature power spectrum are reduced in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations. In particular, the characteristic sharpening of the acoustic peaks of the temperature power spectrum resulting from successful delensing is detected at a significance of 16 sigma , with an amplitude of Adelens=1.12 $\pm$0.07 relative to the expected value of unity. This first demonstration on data of CIB delensing, and of delensing techniques in general, is significant because lensing removal will soon be essential for achieving high-precision constraints on inflationary B -mode polarization.},

	Abstract = {We develop a statistical estimator to infer the redshift probability distribution of a photometric sample of galaxies from its angular cross-correlation in redshift bins with an overlapping spectroscopic sample. This estimator is a minimum-variance weighted quadratic function of the data: a quadratic estimator. This extends and modifies the methodology presented by McQuinn & White. The derived source redshift distribution is degenerate with the source galaxy bias, which must be constrained via additional assumptions. We apply this estimator to constrain source galaxy redshift distributions in the Kilo-Degree imaging survey through cross-correlation with the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey, presenting results first as a binned step-wise distribution in the range z < 0.8, and then building a continuous distribution using a Gaussian process model. We demonstrate the robustness of our methodology using mock catalogues constructed from N-body simulations, and comparisons with other techniques for inferring the redshift distribution.},

	Abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey constant mass (CMASS) sample using 250 deg2 of weak-lensing data from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey. We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogues trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two-dimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40 per cent larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of S_8=sigma _8 \sqrt{Omega _m/0.3} compared to Planck Collaboration XIII reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (r < 10 h-1 Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos and modifications to general relativity on DeltaSigma and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effect of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

	Abstract = {We present a method of calibrating the properties of photometric redshift bins as part of a larger nested sampling analysis for the inference of cosmological parameters. The redshift bins are characterized by their mean and variance, which are varied as free parameters and marginalized over when obtaining the cosmological parameters. We demonstrate that the likelihood function for cross-correlations in an angular power spectrum framework tightly constrains the properties of bins such that they may be well determined, reducing their influence on cosmological parameters and avoiding the bias from poorly estimated redshift distributions. We demonstrate that even with only three photometric and three spectroscopic bins, we can recover accurate estimates of the mean redshift of a bin to within Deltamu ≈ 3-4 × 10-3 and the width of the bin to Deltasigma ≈ 1 × 10-3 for galaxies near z = 1. This indicates that we may be able to bring down the photometric redshift errors to a level which is in line with the requirements for the next generation of cosmological experiments.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of a cross-correlation signal between Fermi Large Area Telescope diffuse gamma-ray maps and catalogs of clusters. In our analysis, we considered three different catalogs: WHL12, redMaPPer, and PlanckSZ. They all show a positive correlation with different amplitudes, related to the average mass of the objects in each catalog, which also sets the catalog bias. The signal detection is confirmed by the results of a stacking analysis. The cross-correlation signal extends to rather large angular scales, around 1$\,^{\circ}$, that correspond, at the typical redshift of the clusters in these catalogs, to a few to tens of megaparsecs, i.e., the typical scale-length of the large-scale structures in the universe. Most likely this signal is contributed by the cumulative emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) associated with the filamentary structures that converge toward the high peaks of the matter density field in which galaxy clusters reside. In addition, our analysis reveals the presence of a second component, more compact in size and compatible with a point-like emission from within individual clusters. At present, we cannot distinguish between the two most likely interpretations for such a signal, i.e., whether it is produced by AGNs inside clusters or if it is a diffuse gamma-ray emission from the intracluster medium. We argue that this latter, intriguing, hypothesis might be tested by applying this technique to a low-redshift large-mass cluster sample.},

	Abstract = {We derive constraints on feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN) by setting limits on their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) imprint on the cosmic microwave background. The amplitude of any SZ signature is small and degenerate with the poorly known sub-mm spectral energy distribution of the AGN host galaxy and other unresolved dusty sources along the line of sight. Here we break this degeneracy by combining microwave and sub-mm data from Planck with all-sky far-infrared maps from the AKARI satellite. We first test our measurement pipeline using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer catalogue of galaxy clusters, finding a highly significant detection (>20sigma) of the SZ effect together with correlated dust emission. We then constrain the SZ signal associated with spectroscopically confirmed quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) from SDSS data release 7 (DR7) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR12. We obtain a low-significance (1.6sigma) hint of an SZ signal, pointing towards a mean thermal energy of ~=5 × 1060 erg, lower than reported in some previous studies. A comparison of our results with high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations including AGN feedback suggests QSO host masses of M200c ˜ 4 × 1012 h-1 M&sun;, but with a large uncertainty. Our analysis provides no conclusive evidence for an SZ signal specifically associated with AGN feedback.},

	Abstract = {Interest in the idea that primordial black holes (PBHs) might comprise some or all of the dark matter has recently been rekindled following LIGO's first direct detection of a binary-black-hole merger. Here we revisit the effect of accreting PBHs on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) frequency spectrum and the angular temperature and polarization power spectra. We compute the accretion rate and luminosity of PBHs, accounting for their suppression by Compton drag and Compton cooling by CMB photons. We estimate the gas temperature near the Schwarzschild radius and, hence, the free-free luminosity, accounting for the cooling resulting from collisional ionization when the background gas is mostly neutral. We account approximately for the velocities of PBHs with respect to the background gas. We provide a simple analytic estimate of the efficiency of energy deposition in the plasma. We find that the spectral distortions generated by accreting PBHs are too small to be detected by FIRAS, as well as by future experiments now being considered. We analyze Planck CMB temperature and polarization data and find, under our most conservative hypotheses, and at the order-of-magnitude level, that they rule out PBHs with masses ≳1 02 M&sun; as the dominant component of dark matter.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing information from the two and higher point statistics of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fields are intrinsically correlated because they are lensed by the same realization of structure between last scattering and observation. Using an analytic model for lens sample covariance, we show that there is one mode, separately measurable in the lensed CMB power spectra and lensing reconstruction, that carries most of this correlation. Once these measurements become lens sample variance dominated, this mode should provide a useful consistency check between the observables that is largely free of sampling and cosmological parameter errors. Violations of consistency could indicate systematic errors in the data and lens reconstruction or new physics at last scattering, any of which could bias cosmological inferences and delensing for gravitational waves. A second mode provides a weaker consistency check for a spatially flat universe. Our analysis isolates the additional information supplied by lensing in a model-independent manner but is also useful for understanding and forecasting CMB cosmological parameter errors in the extended Lambda cold dark matter parameter space of dark energy, curvature, and massive neutrinos. We introduce and test a simple but accurate forecasting technique for this purpose that neither double counts lensing information nor neglects lensing in the observables.},

	Abstract = {We study the reconstruction of the cosmic rotation power spectrum produced by parity-violating physics, with an eye to ongoing and near future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as BICEP Array, CMBS4, LiteBIRD and Simons Observatory. In addition to the inflationary gravitational waves and gravitational lensing, measurements of other various effects on CMB polarization open new window into the early Universe. One of these is anisotropies of the cosmic polarization rotation which probes the Chern-Simons term generally predicted by string theory. The anisotropies of the cosmic rotation are also generated by the primordial magnetism and in the Standard Model extention framework. The cosmic rotation anisotropies can be reconstructed as quadratic in CMB anisotropies. However, the power of the reconstructed cosmic rotation is a CMB four-point correlation and is not directly related to the cosmic-rotation power spectrum. Understanding all contributions in the four-point correlation is required to extract the cosmic rotation signal. Assuming inflationary motivated cosmic-rotation models, we employ simulation to quantify each contribution to the four-point correlation and find that (1) a secondary contraction of the trispectrum increases the total signal-to-noise, (2) a bias from the lensing-induced trispectrum is significant compared to the statistical errors in, e.g., LiteBIRD and CMBS4-like experiments, (3) the use of a realization-dependent estimator decreases the statistical errors by 10%-20%, depending on experimental specifications, and (4) other higher-order contributions are negligible at least for near future experiments.},

	Abstract = {We re-analyse recent Cepheid data to estimate the Hubble parameter H0 by using Bayesian hyper-parameters (HPs). We consider the two data sets from Riess et al. 2011 and 2016 (labelled R11 and R16, with R11 containing less than half the data of R16) and include the available anchor distances (megamaser system NGC4258, detached eclipsing binary distances to LMC and M31, and MW Cepheids with parallaxes), use a weak metallicity prior and no period cut for Cepheids. We find that part of the R11 data is down-weighted by the HPs but that R16 is mostly consistent with expectations for a Gaussian distribution, meaning that there is no need to down-weight the R16 data set. For R16, we find a value of H0 = 73.75 $\pm$ 2.11 km s-1 Mpc-1 if we use HPs for all data points (including Cepheid stars, supernovae type Ia, and the available anchor distances), which is about 2.6 sigma larger than the Planck 2015 value of H0 = 67.81 $\pm$ 0.92 km s-1 Mpc-1 and about 3.1 sigma larger than the updated Planck 2016 value 66.93 $\pm$ 0.62 km s-1 Mpc-1. If we perfom a standard chi2 analysis as in R16, we find H0 = 73.46 $\pm$ 1.40 (stat) km s-1 Mpc-1. We test the effect of different assumptions, and find that the choice of anchor distances affects the final value significantly. If we exclude the Milky Way from the anchors, then the value of H0 decreases. We find however no evident reason to exclude the MW data. The HP method used here avoids subjective rejection criteria for outliers and offers a way to test datasets for unknown systematics.},

	Abstract = {The forecasted accuracy of upcoming surveys of large-scale structure cannot be achieved without a proper quantification of the error induced by foreground removal (or other systematics like 0-point photometry offset). Because these errors are highly correlated on the sky, their influence is expected to be especially important at very large scales, at and beyond the first Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO). In this work we quantify how the uncertainty in the visibility mask of a survey, that gives the survey depth in a specific sky area, influences the measured power spectrum of a sample of tracers of the density field and its covariance matrix. We start from a very large set of 10,000 catalogs of dark matter (DM) halos in periodic cosmological boxes, produced with the PINOCCHIO approximate method. To make an analytic approach feasible, we assume luminosity-independent halo bias and an idealized geometry for the visibility mask, that is constant in square tiles of physical length l; this should be interpreted as the projection, at the observation redshift, of the angular correlation scale of the foreground residuals. We find that the power spectrum of these biased tracers can be expressed as the sum of a cosmological term, a mask term and a term involving their convolution. The mask and convolution terms scale like P propto l2sigmaA2, where sigmaA2 is the variance of the uncertainty on the visibility mask. With l = 30-100 Mpc/h and sigmaA = 5-20%, the mask term can be significant at k ~ 0.01-0.1 h/Mpc, and the convolution term can amount to ~ 1-10% of the total. The influence of mask uncertainty on power spectrum covariance is more complicated: the coupling of the convolution term with the other two gives rise to several mixed terms, that we quantify by difference using the mock catalogs. These are found to be of the same order of the mask covariance, and to introduce non-diagonal terms at large scales. As a consequence, the power spectrum covariance matrix cannot be expressed as the sum of a cosmological and of a mask term. More realistic settings (realistic foregrounds, luminosity-dependent bias) make the analytical approach not feasible, and the problem requires on the one hand usage of extended sets of mock catalogs, on the other hand detailed knowledge of the correlations among errors in the visibility masks. Our results lie down the theoretical bases to quantify the impact that uncertainties in the mask calibration have on the derivation of cosmological constraints from large spectroscopic surveys.},

@article{radovich:2017,
	Abstract = {Aims: In this paper, we present the tools used to search for galaxy clusters in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), and our first results.  Methods: The cluster detection is based on an implementation of the optimal filtering technique that enables us to identify clusters as over-densities in the distribution of galaxies using their positions on the sky, magnitudes, and photometric redshifts. The contamination and completeness of the cluster catalog are derived using mock catalogs based on the data themselves. The optimal signal to noise threshold for the cluster detection is obtained by randomizing the galaxy positions and selecting the value that produces a contamination of less than 20%. Starting from a subset of clusters detected with high significance at low redshifts, we shift them to higher redshifts to estimate the completeness as a function of redshift: the average completeness is  85%. An estimate of the mass of the clusters is derived using the richness as a proxy.  Results: We obtained 1858 candidate clusters with redshift 0 <zc< 0.7 and mass 1013.5 < M500 < 1015 M&sun; in an area of 114 sq. degrees (KiDS ESO-DR2). A comparison with publicly available Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-based cluster catalogs shows that we match more than 50% of the clusters (77% in the case of the redMaPPer catalog). We also cross-matched our cluster catalog with the Abell clusters, and clusters found by XMM and in the Planck-SZ survey; however, only a small number of them lie inside the KiDS area currently available.  The catalog is available at http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/DR2 and at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/598/A107},

	Abstract = {CMB and lensing reconstruction power spectra are powerful probes of cosmology. However, they are correlated, since the CMB power spectra are lensed, and the lensing reconstruction is constructed using CMB multipoles. We perform a full analysis of the auto- and cross-covariances, including polarization power spectra and minimum-variance lensing estimators, and compare with simulations of idealized future CMB-S4 observations. Covariances sourced by fluctuations in the unlensed CMB and instrumental noise can largely be removed by using a realization-dependent subtraction of lensing reconstruction noise, leaving a relatively simple covariance model that is dominated by lensing-induced terms and well described by a small number of principal components. The correlations between the CMB and lensing power spectra will be detectable at the level of ˜5 sigma for a CMB-S4 mission, and neglecting them could underestimate some parameter error bars by several tens of percent. However, we found that the inclusion of external priors or data sets to estimate parameter error bars can make the impact of the correlations almost negligible.},

	Abstract = {Recent results from the BICEP, Keck Array and Planck Collaborations demonstrate that Galactic foregrounds are an unavoidable obstacle in the search for evidence of inflationary gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. Beyond the foregrounds, the effect of lensing by intervening large-scale structure further obscures all but the strongest inflationary signals permitted by current data. With a plethora of ongoing and upcoming experiments aiming to measure these signatures, careful and self-consistent consideration of experiments' foreground- and lensing-removal capabilities is critical in obtaining credible forecasts of their performance. We investigate the capabilities of instruments such as Advanced ACTPol, BICEP3 and Keck Array, CLASS, EBEX10K, PIPER, Simons Array, SPT-3G and SPIDER, and projects as COrE+, LiteBIRD-ext, PIXIE and Stage IV, to clean contamination due to polarized synchrotron and dust from raw multi-frequency data, and remove lensing from the resulting co-added CMB maps (either using iterative CMB-only techniques or through cross-correlation with external data). Incorporating these effects, we present forecasts for the constraining power of these experiments in terms of inflationary physics, the neutrino sector, and dark energy parameters. Made publicly available through an online interface, this tool enables the next generation of CMB experiments to foreground-proof their designs, optimize their frequency coverage to maximize scientific output, and determine where cross-experimental collaboration would be most beneficial. We find that analyzing data from ground, balloon and space instruments in complementary combinations can significantly improve component separation performance, delensing, and cosmological constraints over individual datasets. In particular, we find that a combination of post-2020 ground- and space-based experiments could achieve constraints such as sigma(r)~1.3×10-4, sigma(nt)~0.03, sigma( ns )~1.8×10-3, sigma(alphas)~1.7×10-3, sigma( Mnu )~31 meV, sigma( w )~0.09, sigma( w0 )~ 0.25, 0sigma( wa )~ 0.5, sigma( Neff )~0.024 and sigma( Omegak )~1.5×10-3, after component separation and iterative delensing.},

	Abstract = {The B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background on large scales has been considered as a probe of gravitational waves from the cosmic inflation. Ongoing and future experiments will, however, suffer from contamination due to the B-modes of non-primordial origins, one of which is the lensing induced B-mode polarization. Subtraction of the lensing B-modes, usually referred to as delensing, will be required for further improvement of detection sensitivity of the gravitational waves. In such experiments, knowledge of statistical properties of the B-modes after delensing is indispensable to likelihood analysis particularly because the lensing B-modes are known to be non-Gaussian. In this paper, we study non-Gaussian structure of the delensed B-modes on large scales, comparing it with that of the lensing B-modes. In particular, we investigate the power spectrum correlation matrix and the probability distribution function (PDF) of the power spectrum amplitude. Assuming an experiment in which the quadratic delensing is an almost optimal method, we find that delensing reduces correlations of the lensing B-mode power spectra between different multipoles, and that the PDF of the power spectrum amplitude is well described as a normal distribution function with a variance larger than that in the case of a Gaussian field. These features are well captured by an analytic model based on the 4th order Edgeworth expansion. As a consequence of the non-Gaussianity, the constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio after delensing is degraded within approximately a few percent, which depends on the multipole range included in the analysis.},

	Abstract = {We explore the potential use of the Radio Continuum (RC) survey conducted by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to remove (delens) the lensing-induced B-mode polarization and thus enhance future cosmic microwave background (CMB) searches for inflationary gravitational waves. Measurements of large-scale B-modes of the CMB are considered to be the best method for probing gravitational waves from the cosmic inflation. Future CMB experiments will, however, suffer from contamination by nonprimordial B modes, one source of which is the lensing B modes. Delensing, therefore, will be required for further improvement of the detection sensitivity for gravitational waves. Analyzing the use of the two-dimensional map of galaxy distribution provided by the SKA RC survey as a lensing mass tracer, we find that joint delensing using near-future CMB experiments and the SKA phase 1 will improve the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by more than a factor of ˜2 compared to those without the delensing analysis. Compared to the use of CMB data alone, the inclusion of the SKA phase 1 data will increase the significance of the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by a factor 1.2-1.6. For LiteBIRD combined with a ground-based experiment such as Simons Array and Advanced ACT, the constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio when adding SKA phase 2 data is improved by a factor of 2.3-2.7, whereas delensing with CMB data alone improves the constraints by only a factor 1.3-1.7. We conclude that the use of SKA data is a promising method for delensing upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing by large-scale structure significantly impacts observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): it smooths the acoustic peaks in temperature and $E$-mode polarization power spectra, correlating previously uncorrelated modes; and it converts $E$-mode polarization into $B$-mode polarization. The act of measuring and removing the effect of lensing from CMB maps, or delensing, has been well studied in the context of $B$ modes, but little attention has been given to the delensing of the temperature and $E$ modes. In this paper, we model the expected delensed $T$ and $E$ power spectra to all orders in the lensing potential, demonstrating the sharpening of the acoustic peaks and a significant reduction in lens-induced power spectrum covariances. We then perform cosmological forecasts, demonstrating that delensing will yield improved sensitivity to parameters with upcoming surveys. We highlight the breaking of the degeneracy between the effective number of neutrino species and primordial helium fraction as a concrete application. We also show that delensing increases cosmological information as long as the measured lensing reconstruction is included in the analysis. We conclude that with future data, delensing will be crucial not only for primordial $B$-mode science but for a range of other observables as well.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to delens the acoustic peaks of the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra internally, using lensing maps reconstructed from the CMB itself. We find that when delensing CMB acoustic peaks with a lensing potential map derived from the same CMB sky, a large bias arises in the delensed power spectrum. The cause of this bias is that the noise in the reconstructed potential map is derived from, and hence correlated with, the CMB map when delensing. This bias is more significant relative to the signal than an analogous bias found when delensing CMB B modes. We calculate the leading term of this bias, which is present even in the absence of lensing. We also demonstrate one method to remove this bias, using reconstructions from CMB angular scales within given ranges to delens CMB scales outside of those ranges. Some details relevant for a realistic analysis are also discussed, such as the importance of removing mask-induced effects for successful delensing, and a useful null test, obtained from randomizing the phases of the reconstructed potential. Our findings should help current and next-generation CMB experiments obtain tighter parameter constraints via the internal removal of lensing-induced smoothing from temperature and E-mode acoustic peaks.},

	Abstract = {We present a first internal delensing of CMB maps, both in temperature and polarization, using the public foreground-cleaned (SMICA) Planck 2015 maps. After forming quadratic estimates of the lensing potential, we use the corresponding displacement field to undo the lensing on the same data. We build differences of the delensed spectra to the original data spectra specifically to look for delensing signatures. After taking into account reconstruction noise biases in the delensed spectra, we find an expected sharpening of the power spectrum acoustic peaks with a delensing efficiency of $29\,\%$ ($TT$) $25\,\%$ ($TE$) and $22\,\%$ ($EE$). The detection significance of the delensing effects is very high in all spectra: $12\,\sigma$ in $EE$ polarization; $18\,\sigma$ in $TE$; and $20\,\sigma$ in $TT$. The null hypothesis of no lensing in the maps is rejected at $26\,\sigma$. While direct detection of the power in lensing $B$-modes themselves is not possible at high significance at Planck noise levels, we do detect (at $4.5\,\sigma$ under the null hypothesis) delensing effects in the $B$-mode map, with $7\,\%$ reduction in lensing power. Our results provide a first demonstration of polarization delensing, and generally of internal CMB delensing, and stand in agreement with the baseline $\Lambda$CDM Planck 2015 cosmology expectations.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for delensing $B$ modes of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using a lensing potential reconstructed from the same realization of the CMB polarization (CMB internal delensing). The $B$-mode delensing is required to improve sensitivity to primary $B$ modes generated by, e.g., the inflationary gravitational waves, axion-like particles, modified gravity, primordial magnetic fields, and topological defects such as cosmic strings. However, the CMB internal delensing suffers from substantial biases due to correlations between observed CMB maps to be delensed and that used for reconstructing a lensing potential. We construct a realization-dependent (RD) estimator for correcting these biases by deriving a general optimal estimator for higher-order correlations. The RD estimator is less sensitive to simulation uncertainties. Compared to the previous methods, we find that the RD estimator corrects the biases without substantial degradation of the delensing efficiency.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that, for the baseline design of the CORE satellite mission, the polarized foregrounds can be controlled at the level required to allow the detection of the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization with the desired accuracy at both reionization and recombination scales, for tensor-to-scalar ratio values of $r\gtrsim 5\times 10^{-3}$. Under the assumption of perfect control of lensing effects, CORE would measure an unbiased estimate of $r=5\times 10^{-3}$ with an uncertainty of ${\sigma(r=5\times 10^{-3})=0.4\times 10^{-3}}$ after foreground cleaning. In presence of both gravitational lensing effects and astrophysical foregrounds, the significance of the detection is lowered, with CORE achieving yet a $4\sigma$-measurement of $r=5\times 10^{-3}$ after foreground cleaning and $60$% delensing. We deliberately consider detailed sky simulations based on state-of-the-art CMB observations that consist of CMB polarization with $\tau=0.055$ and tensor-to-scalar values ranging from $r=10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$, Galactic synchrotron and thermal dust polarization with variable spectral indices over the sky, polarized anomalous microwave emission, polarized infrared and radio sources, and gravitational lensing effects. Using both parametric and blind approaches, we perform the full component separation and likelihood analysis of the simulations, allowing us to quantify both uncertainties and biases on the reconstructed primordial $B$-modes. We report two sources of potential bias for the detection of the primordial B-modes by future CMB experiments: (i) incorrect foreground models, (ii) averaging of foreground spectral indices by pixellization and beam convolution.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the CMB is a valuable cosmological signal that correlates to tracers of large-scale structure and acts as a important source of confusion for primordial $B$-mode polarization. State-of-the-art lensing reconstruction analyses use quadratic estimators, which are easily applicable to data. However, these estimators are known to be suboptimal, in particular for polarization, and large improvements are expected to be possible for high signal-to-noise polarization experiments. We develop a method and numerical code, $\rm{LensIt}$, that is able to find efficiently the most probable lensing map, introducing no significant approximations to the lensed CMB likelihood, and applicable to beamed and masked data with inhomogeneous noise. It works by iteratively reconstructing the primordial unlensed CMB using a deflection estimate and its inverse, and removing residual lensing from these maps with quadratic estimator techniques. Roughly linear computational cost is maintained due to fast convergence of iterative searches, combined with the local nature of lensing. The method achieves the maximal improvement in signal to noise expected from analytical considerations on the unmasked parts of the sky. Delensing with this optimal map leads to forecast tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter errors improved by a factor $\simeq 2 $ compared to the quadratic estimator in a CMB stage IV configuration.},

@article{yu:2017,
	Abstract = {Delensing, the removal of the limiting lensing B-mode background, is crucial for the success of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys in constraining inflationary gravitational waves (IGWs). In recent work, delensing with large-scale structure tracers has emerged as a promising method both for improving constraints on IGWs and for testing delensing methods for future use. However, the delensing fractions (i.e., the fraction of the lensing-B mode power removed) achieved by recent efforts have been only $20-30\%$. In this work, we provide a detailed characterization of a full-sky, dust-cleaned cosmic infrared background (CIB) map for delensing and construct a further-improved delensing template by adding additional tracers to increase delensing performance. In particular, we build a multi-tracer delensing template by combining the dust-cleaned Planck CIB map with a reconstructed CMB lensing map from Planck and a galaxy number density map from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite. For this combination, we calculate the relevant weightings by fitting smooth templates to measurements of all the cross- and auto-spectra of these maps. On a large fraction of the sky ($f_\mathrm{sky}=0.43$), we demonstrate that our maps are capable of providing a delensing factor of $43 \pm 1\%$; using a more restrictive mask ($f_\mathrm{sky}=0.11$), the delensing factor reaches $48 \pm 1\%$. For low-noise surveys, our delensing maps, which cover much of the sky, can thus improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) by nearly a factor of 2. The delensing tracer maps are made publicly available and we encourage their use in ongoing and upcoming B-mode surveys.},

	Abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has completed its all-sky survey in four channels at 3.4-22 mum, detecting hundreds of millions of objects. We merge the WISE mid-infrared data with optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and provide a phenomenological characterization of WISE extragalactic sources. WISE is most sensitive at 3.4 mum (W1) and least sensitive at 22 mum (W4). The W1 band probes massive early-type galaxies out to z >~ 1. This is more distant than SDSS identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of 3.4 mum sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r > 22.2). In contrast, 92%-95% of 12 mum and 22 mum sources have SDSS optical counterparts with r <= 22.2. WISE 3.4 mum detects 89.8% of the entire SDSS QSO catalog at S/N W1 >7sigma, but only 18.9% at 22 mum with S/N W4 > 5sigma. We show that WISE colors alone are effective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forming galaxies, and strong active galactic nuclei (AGNs)/QSOs at z <~ 3. We highlight three major applications of WISE colors: (1) Selection of strong AGNs/QSOs at z <= 3 using W1 - W2 > 0.8 and W2 < 15.2 criteria, producing a better census of this population. The surface density of these strong AGN/QSO candidates is 67.5 $\pm$ 0.14 deg-2. (2) Selection of dust-obscured, type-2 AGN/QSO candidates. We show that WISE W1 - W2 > 0.8, W2 < 15.2 combined with r - W2 > 6 (Vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 AGN candidates. The fraction of these type-2 AGN candidates is one-third of all WISE color-selected AGNs. (3) Selection of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z ~ 2 with extremely red colors, r - W4 > 14 or well-detected 22 mum sources lacking detections in the 3.4 and 4.6 mum bands. The surface density of z ~ 2 ULIRG candidates selected with r - W4 > 14 is 0.9 $\pm$ 0.07 deg-2 at S/N W4 >= 5 (the corresponding, lowest flux density of 2.5 mJy), which is consistent with that inferred from smaller area Spitzer surveys. Optical spectroscopy of a small number of these high-redshift ULIRG candidates confirms our selection, and reveals a possible trend that optically fainter or r - W4 redder candidates are at higher redshifts.},

	Abstract = {The Thomson optical depth from reionization is a limiting factor in measuring the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, and hence in measuring physics that affects the low-redshift amplitude, such as the neutrino masses. Current constraints on the optical depth, based on directly measuring large-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, are challenging due to foregrounds and systematic effects. Here, we consider an indirect measurement of large-scale polarization, using observed maps of small-scale polarization together with maps of fields that distort the CMB, such as CMB lensing and patchy reionization. We find that very futuristic CMB surveys will be able to reconstruct large-scale polarization, and thus the mean optical depth, using only measurements on small scales.},

@article{schmittfull:2013,
	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing provides a significant source of cosmological information in modern cosmic microwave background parameter analyses. It is measured in both the power spectrum and trispectrum of the temperature fluctuations. These observables are often treated as independent, although as they are both determined from the same map, this is impossible. In this paper, we perform a rigorous analysis of the covariance between lensing power spectrum and trispectrum analyses. We find two dominant contributions coming from (i) correlations between the disconnected noise bias in the trispectrum measurement and sample variance in the temperature power spectrum and (ii) sample variance of the lenses themselves. The former is naturally removed when the dominant N(0) Gaussian bias in the reconstructed deflection spectrum is dealt with via a partially data-dependent correction, as advocated elsewhere for other reasons. The remaining lens-cosmic-variance contribution is easily modeled but can safely be ignored for a Planck-like experiment, justifying treating the two observable spectra as independent. We also test simple likelihood approximations for the deflection power spectrum, finding that a Gaussian with a parameter-independent covariance performs well.},

	Abstract = {We present new methods for lensing reconstruction from CMB temperature fluctuations which have smaller mean-field and reconstruction noise bias corrections than current lensing estimators, with minimal loss of signal to noise. These biases are usually corrected using Monte Carlo simulations, and to the extent that these simulations do not perfectly mimic the underlying sky, there are uncertainties in the bias corrections. The bias-hardened estimators which we present can have reduced sensitivity to such uncertainties, and provide a desirable cross-check on standard results. To test our approach, we also show the results of lensing reconstruction from simulated temperature maps given on 10 × 10 deg2, and confirm that our approach works well to reduce biases for a typical masked map in which 70 square masks each having 10 arcmin on a side exist, covering 2 per cent of the simulated map, which is similar to the masks used in the current SPT lensing analysis.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of polarization lensing using the 150 GHz maps, which include all data taken by the BICEP2 and Keck Array Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). Despite their modest angular resolution (˜ 0.5$\,^{\circ}$), the excellent sensitivity (˜3muK-arcmin) of  these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the lensing potential  using only information at larger angular scales ({l}<=700). From the  auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential, we measure an amplitude of  the spectrum to be ALphi phi=1.15+/- 0.36 (Planck LambdaCDM prediction corresponds to ALphi phi =1) and reject the no-lensing hypothesis at 5.8sigma , which is the highest significance achieved to date using an EB lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of the reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields ALphi phi =1.13+/- 0.20. These direct measurements of  ALphi phi are consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology and with that derived from the previously reported BK14 B-mode auto-spectrum (AL{BB}=1.20+/- 0.17). We perform a series of null tests and consistency checks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are insensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the B modes previously reported by BICEP/Keck at intermediate angular scales (150≲ l ≲ 350) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The good agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing reconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any alternative cosmological sources of B modes at these angular scales.},

	Abstract = {We report a measurement of the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing from two seasons of Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) CMB data. The CMB lensing power spectrum is extracted from both temperature and polarization data using quadratic estimators. We obtain results that are consistent with the expectation from the best-fit Planck LCDM model over a range of multipoles L=80-2100, with an amplitude of lensing A_lens = 1.06 +/- 0.15 (stat.) +/- 0.06 (sys.) relative to Planck. Our measurement of the CMB lensing power spectrum gives sigma_8 Omega_m^0.25 = 0.643 +/- 0.054; including baryon acoustic oscillation scale data, we constrain the amplitude of density fluctuations to be sigma_8 = 0.831 +/- 0.053. We also update constraints on the neutrino mass sum. We verify our lensing measurement with a number of null tests and systematic checks, finding no evidence of significant systematic errors. This measurement relies on a small fraction of the ACTPol data already taken; more precise lensing results can therefore be expected from the full ACTPol dataset.},

	Abstract = {These notes aim at presenting an overview of Bayesian statistics, the underlying concepts and application methodology that will be useful to astronomers seeking to analyse and interpret a wide variety of data about the Universe. The level starts from elementary notions, without assuming any previous knowledge of statistical methods, and then progresses to more advanced, research-level topics. After an introduction to the importance of statistical inference for the physical sciences, elementary notions of probability theory and inference are introduced and explained. Bayesian methods are then presented, starting from the meaning of Bayes Theorem and its use as inferential engine, including a discussion on priors and posterior distributions. Numerical methods for generating samples from arbitrary posteriors (including Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Nested Sampling) are then covered. The last section deals with the topic of Bayesian model selection and how it is used to assess the performance of models, and contrasts it with the classical p-value approach. A series of exercises of various levels of difficulty are designed to further the understanding of the theoretical material, including fully worked out solutions for most of them.},

@article{campagne:2017,
	Abstract = {The statistical distribution of galaxies is a powerful probe to constrain cosmological models and gravity. In particular the matter power spectrum $P(k)$ brings information about the cosmological distance evolution and the galaxy clustering together. However the building of $P(k)$ from galaxy catalogues needs a cosmological model to convert angles on the sky and redshifts into distances, which leads to difficulties when comparing data with predicted $P(k)$ from other cosmological models, and for photometric surveys like LSST. The angular power spectrum $C_\ell(z_1,z_2)$ between two bins located at redshift $z_1$ and $z_2$ contains the same information than the matter power spectrum, is free from any cosmological assumption, but the prediction of $C_\ell(z_1,z_2)$ from $P(k)$ is a costly computation when performed exactly. The Angpow software aims at computing quickly and accurately the auto ($z_1=z_2$) and cross ($z_1 \neq z_2$) angular power spectra between redshift bins. We describe the developed algorithm, based on developments on the Chebyshev polynomial basis and on the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature method. We validate the results with other codes, and benchmark the performance. Angpow is flexible and can handle any user defined power spectra, transfer functions, and redshift selection windows. The code is fast enough to be embedded inside programs exploring large cosmological parameter spaces through the $C_\ell(z_1,z_2)$ comparison with data. We emphasize that the Limber's approximation, often used to fasten the computation, gives wrong $C_\ell$ values for cross-correlations.},

@article{bohm:2017,
	Abstract = {We present a Bayesian reconstruction algorithm that infers the three-dimensional large-scale matter distribution from the weak gravitational lensing effects measured in the image shapes of galaxies. The algorithm assumes that the prior probability distribution of the matter density is lognormal, in contrast to many existing methods that assume normal (Gaussian) distributed density fields. We compare the reconstruction results for both priors in a suite of increasingly realistic tests on mock data. We find that in cases of high noise levels (i.e. for low source galaxy densities and/or high shape measurement uncertainties), both normal and lognormal priors lead to reconstructions of comparable quality. In the low-noise regime, however, the lognormal model produces significantly better reconstructions than the normal model: The lognormal model 1) enforces non-negative densities, while negative densities are present when a normal prior is employed, 2) better traces the extremal values and the skewness of the true underlying distribution, and 3) yields a higher correlation between the reconstruction and the true density distribution. Hence, the lognormal model is to be preferred over the normal model, in particular since these differences become relevant for data from current and futures surveys.},

	Abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous under- standing of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is con- fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex- haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

	Abstract = {Consistency relations of large-scale structures provide exact nonperturbative results for cross-correlations of cosmic fields in the squeezed limit. They only depend on the equivalence principle and the assumption of Gaussian initial conditions, and remain nonzero at equal times for cross-correlations of density fields with velocity or momentum fields, or with the time derivative of density fields. We show how to apply these relations to observational probes that involve the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. In the squeezed limit, this allows us to express the three-point cross-correlations, or bispectra, of two galaxy or matter density fields, or weak lensing convergence fields, with the secondary CMB distortion in terms of products of a linear and a nonlinear power spectrum. In particular, we find that cross-correlations with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect show a specific angular dependence. These results could be used to test the equivalence principle and the primordial Gaussianity, or to check the modeling of large-scale structures.},

	Abstract = {The forecasted accuracy of upcoming surveys of large-scale structure cannot be achieved without a proper quantification of the error induced by foreground removal (or other systematics like 0-point photometry offset). Because these errors are highly correlated on the sky, their influence is expected to be especially important at very large scales. In this work we quantify how the uncertainty in the visibility mask of a survey influences the measured power spectrum of a sample of tracers of the density field and its covariance matrix. We start from a very large set of 10,000 catalogs of dark matter halos in periodic cosmological boxes, produced with the PINOCCHIO approximate method. To make an analytic approach feasible, we assume luminosity-independent halo bias and an idealized geometry for the visibility mask. We find that the power spectrum of these biased tracers can be expressed as the sum of a cosmological term, a mask term and a term involving their convolution. The mask and convolution terms scale like $P\propto l^2\sigma_A^2$, where $\sigma_A^2$ is the variance of the uncertainty on the visibility mask. With $l=30-100$ Mpc$/h$ and $\sigma_A=5-20$\%, the mask term can be significant at $k\sim0.01-0.1\ h/$Mpc, and the convolution term can amount to $\sim 1-10$\% of the total. For the power spectrum covariance, the coupling of the convolution term with the other two gives rise to several mixed terms, that we quantify by difference using the mock catalogs. These are found to be of the same order of the mask covariance, and to introduce non-diagonal terms at large scales. Then, the power spectrum covariance matrix cannot be expressed as the sum of a cosmological and of a mask term. Our results lie down the theoretical bases to quantify the impact that uncertainties in the mask calibration have on the derivation of cosmological constraints from large spectroscopic surveys.

	Abstract = {Subject of this article is the relationship between modern cosmology and fundamental physics, in particular general relativity as a theory of gravity on one side, together with its unique application in cosmology, and the formation of structures and their statistics on the other. It summarises arguments for the formulation for a metric theory of gravity and the uniqueness of the construction of general relativity. It discusses symmetry arguments in the construction of Friedmann-Lema\^itre cosmologies as well as assumptions in relation to the presence of dark matter, when adopting general relativity as the gravitational theory. A large section is dedicated to $\Lambda$CDM as the standard model for structure formation and the arguments that led to its construction, and to the of role statistics and to the problem of scientific inference in cosmology as an empirical science. The article concludes with an outlook on current and future developments in cosmology.},

	Abstract = {We study the gravitational lensing effect on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies performing a ray-tracing of the primordial CMB photons through intervening large-scale structures (LSS) distribution predicted by N-Body numerical simulations with a particular focus on the precise recovery of the lens-induced polarized counterpart of the source plane. We apply both a multiple plane ray-tracing and an effective deflection approach based on the Born approximation to deflect the CMB photons trajectories through the simulated lightcone. We discuss the results obtained with both these methods together with the impact of LSS non-linear evolution on the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra. We compare our results with semi-analytical approximations implemented in Boltzmann codes like, e.g., CAMB. We show that, with our current N-body setup, the predicted lensing power is recovered with good accuracy in a wide range of multipoles while excess power with respect to semi-analytic prescriptions is observed in the lensing potential on scales l gtrsim 3000. We quantify the impact of the numerical effects connected to the resolution in the N-Body simulation together with the resolution and band-limit chosen to synthesise the CMB source plane. We found these quantities to be particularly important for the simulation of B-mode polarization power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Cosmic Microwave Background lensing simulation by Taylor expansion has long been considered impractical due to slow convergence, but a recent flat-sky implementation shows that a simple trick eliminates this problem, making Taylor lensing a fast and simple lensing algorithm for the flat sky. Here we generalize the method to the full sky, and study its convergence and performance relative to a commonly used numerical code, Lenspix, with extensive benchmarks of both. Compared to the flat sky case, the method takes a speed hit due to the slow speed of spherical harmonic transforms compared to fast Fourier transforms, resulting in speeds of 1/3 to 2/3 of Lenspix for similar accuracy.},

	Abstract = {We studied the accuracy, robustness, and self-consistency of pixel-domain simulations of the gravitational lensing effect on the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies due to the large-scale structure of the Universe. In particular, we investigated the dependence of the precision of the results precision on some crucial parameters of these techniques and propose a semi-analytic framework to determine their values so that the required precision is a priori assured and the numerical workload simultaneously optimized. Our focus was on the B-mode signal, but we also discuss other CMB observables, such as the total intensity, T, and E-mode polarization, emphasizing differences and similarities between all these cases. Our semi-analytic considerations are backed up by extensive numerical results. Those are obtained using a code, nicknamed lenS2HAT - for lensing using scalable spherical harmonic transforms (S2HAT) - which we have developed in the course of this work. The code implements a version of the previously described pixel-domain approach and permits performing the simulations at very high resolutions and data volumes, thanks to its efficient parallelization provided by the S2HAT library - a parallel library for calculating of the spherical harmonic transforms. The code is made publicly available.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the ability of galaxy and CMB lensing surveys to constrain massive neutrinos and new models of dark radiation. We present a Fisher forecast analysis for neutrino mass constraints with the LSST galaxy survey and the CMB S4 survey. A joint analysis of the three galaxy and shear 2-point functions, along with key systematics parameters and Planck priors, constrains the neutrino masses to $\sum m_\nu = 0.041\,$eV at 1-$\sigma$ level, comparable to constraints expected from Stage 4 CMB lensing. If low redshift information from upcoming spectroscopic surveys like DESI is included, the constraint becomes $\sum m_\nu = 0.032\,$eV. These constraints are derived having marginalized over the number of relativistic species ($N_{\rm eff}$), which is somewhat degenerate with the neutrino mass. We conclude that advances in modeling the nonlinear regime and the measurements of other parameters are required to ensure a neutrino mass detection. Using the same datasets, we explore the ability of LSST-era surveys to test "nonstandard" models with dark radiation. We find that if evidence for dark radiation is found from $N_{\rm eff}$ measurements, the mass of the dark radiation candidate can be measured at a 1-$\sigma$ level of $0.162\,$eV for fermionic dark radiation, and $0.137\,$eV for bosonic dark radiation, for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.15$. We also find that the NNaturalness model of Arkani-Hamed et al \cite{Arkani-Hamed2016}, with extra light degrees of freedom, has a sub-percent effect on the power spectrum: even more ambitious surveys than the ones considered here will be needed to test such models.},

@article{gerbino:2016,
	Abstract = {We present a novel approach to derive constraints on neutrino masses from cosmological data, while taking into account our ignorance of the neutrino mass ordering. We derive constraints from a combination of current and future cosmological datasets on the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and on the mass fractions carried by each of the mass eigenstates, after marginalizing over the (unknown) neutrino mass ordering, either normal (NH) or inverted (IH). The bounds take therefore into account the uncertainty related to our ignorance of the mass hierarchy. This novel approach is carried out in the framework of Bayesian analysis of a typical hierarchical problem. In this context, the choice of the neutrino mass ordering is modeled via the discrete hyperparameter $h_{type}$. The preference for either the NH or the IH scenarios is then encoded in the posterior distribution of $h_{type}$ itself. Current CMB measurements assign equal odds to the two hierarchies, and are thus unable to distinguish between them. However, after the addition of BAO measurements, a weak preference for NH appears, with odds of 4:3 from Planck temperature and large-scale polarization in combination with BAO (3:2 if small-scale polarization is also included). Forecasts suggest that the combination of upcoming CMB (COrE) and BAO surveys (DESI) may determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a high statistical significance if the mass is very close to the minimal value allowed by oscillations, as for NH and $M_\nu=0.06$ eV there is a 9:1 preference of NH vs IH. On the contrary, if $M_\nu$ is of the order of 0.1 eV or larger, even future cosmological observations will be inconclusive. The unbiased limit on $M_\nu$ we obtain with this innovative statistical strategy is crucial for ongoing and planned neutrinoless double beta decay searches.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the commonly-used approximations for two-point cosmic shear statistics. We discuss the four most prominent assumptions in this statistic: the flat-sky, tomographic, Limber and configuration-space approximations, that the vast majority of cosmic shear results to date have used simultaneously. Of these approximations we find that the flat-sky approximation suppresses power by >1% on scales of l<100 and the standard Limber approximation implementation enhances power by >5% on scales l<100; in doing so we find an l-dependent factor that has been neglected in analyses to date. To investigate the impact of these approximations we reanalyse the CFHTLenS 2D correlation function results. When using all approximations we reproduce the result that measurements of the matter power spectrum amplitude are in tension with measurements from the CMB Planck data: where a conditional value of sigma8=0.789 +/- 0.015 is found from CFHTLenS and sigma8=0.830 +/- 0.015 from Planck. When we do not use the Limber and flat-sky approximations we find a conditional value of sigma8=0.801 +/- 0.016 from the CFHTLenS data, significantly reducing the tension between Planck CMB results and lensing results from CFHTLenS. When including the additional effect of expected photometric redshift biases we find sigma8=0.839 +/- 0.017 which is consistent with Planck. We also discuss the impact on CMB lensing. For Euclid, LSST, and WFIRST and any current or future survey none of these approximations should be used.},

	Abstract = {Recent observational progress has led to the establishment of the standard Lambda CDM model for cosmology. This development is based on different cosmological probes that are usually combined through their likelihoods at the latest stage in the analysis. We implement here an integrated scheme for cosmological probes, which are combined in a common framework starting at the map level. This treatment is necessary as the probes are generally derived from overlapping maps and are thus not independent. It also allows for a thorough test of the cosmological model and of systematics through the consistency of different physical tracers. As a first application, we combine current measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the Planck satellite, and galaxy clustering and weak lensing from SDSS. We consider the spherical harmonic power spectra of these probes including all six auto- and cross-correlations along with the associated full Gaussian covariance matrix. This provides an integrated treatment of different analyses usually performed separately including CMB anisotropies, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect with galaxy and shear tracers. We derive constraints on Lambda CDM parameters that are compatible with existing constraints and highlight tensions between data sets, which become apparent in this integrated treatment. We discuss how this approach provides a complete and powerful integrated framework for probe combination and how it can be extended to include other tracers in the context of current and future wide-field cosmological surveys.},

	Abstract = {Single-field slow-roll inflation predicts a nearly scale-free power spectrum of perturbations, as observed at the scales accessible to current cosmological experiments. This spectrum is slightly red, showing a tilt $(1-n_s)\sim 0.04$. A direct consequence of this tilt are nonvanishing runnings $\alpha_s=\mathrm d n_s/\mathrm d\log k$, and $\beta_s=\mathrm d\alpha_s/\mathrm d\log k$, which in the minimal inflationary scenario should reach absolute values of $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively. In this work we calculate how well future surveys can measure these two runnings. We consider a Stage-4 (S4) CMB experiment and show that it will be able to detect significant deviations from the inflationary prediction for $\alpha_s$, although not for $\beta_s$. Adding to the S4 CMB experiment the information from a WFIRST-like, a DESI-like, or a SKA-like galaxy survey improves the sensitivity to the runnings by $\sim$ 5\%, 15\%, and 25\%, respectively. A spectroscopic survey with a billion objects, such as SKA2, will add enough information to the S4 measurements to allow a detection of $\alpha_s=10^{-3}$, required to probe the single-field slow-roll inflationary paradigm. We show that a kilometer-long Epoch-of-Reionization interferometric array can also reach this level of sensitivity to $\alpha_s$, although only a more futuristic dark-ages array will be capable of measuring the minimal inflationary prediction for $\beta_s$. The results of other probes, such as a stochastic background of gravitational waves observable by LIGO, the Ly-$\alpha$ forest, and spectral distortions, are shown for comparison. Finally, we study the claims that large values of $\beta_s$, if extrapolated to the smallest scales, can produce primordial black holes of tens of solar masses, which we show to be easily testable by the S4 CMB experiment.},

CMB-S4 will dramatically advance cosmological studies by crossing critical thresholds in the search for the B-mode polarization signature of primordial gravitational waves, in the determination of the number and masses of the neutrinos, in the search for evidence of new light relics, in constraining the nature of dark energy, and in testing general relativity on large scales.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the power spectrum of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), Data Release 12 (DR12) to constrain the relative velocity effect, which represents a potential systematic for measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale. The relative velocity effect is caused by a relative density $\delta_{\rm bc}$ between baryons and cold dark matter at decoupling, which sources a relative velocity $v_{\rm bc}$ between the two components. Our power spectrum model includes all $1$-loop redshift-space terms corresponding to $v_{\rm bc}$ parameterized by the bias parameter $b_{v^2}$. We also include the linear terms proportional to $\delta_{\rm bc}$ and $\theta_{\rm bc}$ which we parameterize with the bias parameters $b^{\rm bc}_{\delta}$ and $b^{\rm bc}_{\theta}$. Our data does not support a detection of the relative velocity effect in any of these parameters. Combining the low and high redshift bins of BOSS, we find limits of $b_{v^2} = 0.012 \pm 0.015 (\pm 0.031)$, $b^{\rm bc}_{\delta} = -1.0 \pm 2.5 (\pm 6.2)$ and $b^{\rm bc}_{\theta} = -114 \pm 55 (\pm 175)$ with $68\%$ ($95\%$) confidence levels. These constraints restrict the potential systematic shift in $D_A(z)$, $H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8$, due to the relative velocity, to $1\%$, $0.8\%$ and $2\%$, respectively. Given the current uncertainties on the BAO measurements of BOSS these shifts correspond to $0.53\sigma$, $0.5\sigma$ and $0.22\sigma$ for $D_A(z)$, $H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8$, respectively.},

	Abstract = {The delensing procedure is an effective tool for removing lensing-induced $B$-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background to allow for deep searches of primordial $B$-modes. However, the delensing algorithm existing in the literature breaks down if the target $B$-mode signals overlap significantly with the lensing $B$-mode ($\sim 300<l<2000$) in multipole-$l$ space. In this paper, we identify the cause of the breakdown to be correlations between the input $B$-map and the deflection field estimator ($EB$). The amplitude of this bias is quantified by numerical simulations and compared to the analytically derived functional form. We also propose a revised delensing procedure that circumvents the bias. While the newly identified bias does not affect the search of degree scale $B$-mode generated by tensor perturbations, the modified delensing algorithm makes it possible to perform deep searches of high-$l$ $B$-modes such as those generated by patchy reionization, cosmic strings, or rotation of polarization angles. Finally, we estimate how well future polarization experiments can do in detecting tensor- and cosmic string- generated $B$-mode after delensing and comment on different survey strategies.},

	Abstract = {We forecast the scientific capabilities of CORE, a proposed CMB space satellite submitted in response to the ESA fifth call for a medium-size mission opportunity, to improve our understanding of cosmic inflation. The CORE mission will map the CMB anisotropies in temperature and polarization in 19 frequency channels spanning the range 60-600 GHz. CORE will have an aggregate noise sensitivity of $1.7 \mu$ K$\cdot \,$arcmin and an angular resolution of 5' at 200 GHz. We explore the impact of telescope size and noise sensitivity on the inflation science return by making forecasts for several instrumental configurations. This study assumes that the lower and higher frequency channels suffice to remove foreground contaminations and complements other related studies of component separation and systematic effects, which will be reported in other papers of the series "Exploring Cosmic Origins with CORE." We forecast the capability to determine key inflationary parameters, to lower the detection limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio down to the Lyth bound, to chart the landscape of single field slow-roll inflationary models, to constrain the epoch of reheating, thus connecting inflation to the standard radiation-matter dominated Big Bang era, to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum, to constrain the contribution from isocurvature perturbations to the $10^{-3}$ level, to improve constraints on the cosmic string tension to a level below the presumptive GUT scale, and to improve the current measurements of primordial non-Gaussianities down to the $f_{NL}^{\rm local} < 1$ level. For all the models explored, CORE alone will improve significantly on the present constraints on the physics of inflation, and its capabilities will be further enhanced in combination with complementary future cosmological observations.},

	Abstract = {Cross correlations between the galaxy number density in a lensing source sample and that in an overlapping spectroscopic sample can in principle be used to calibrate the lensing source redshift distribution. In this paper, we study in detail to what extent this cross-correlation method can mitigate the loss of cosmological information in upcoming weak lensing surveys (combined with a cosmic microwave background prior) due to lack of knowledge of the source distribution. We consider a scenario where photometric redshifts are available and find that, unless the photometric redshift distribution p(z ph|z) is calibrated very accurately a priori (bias and scatter known to ~0.002 for, e.g., EUCLID), the additional constraint on p(z ph|z) from the cross-correlation technique to a large extent restores the cosmological information originally lost due to the uncertainty in dn/dz(z). Considering only the gain in photo-z accuracy and not the additional cosmological information, enhancements of the dark energy figure of merit of up to a factor of four (40) can be achieved for a SuMIRe-like (EUCLID-like) combination of lensing and redshift surveys, where SuMIRe stands for Subaru Measurement of Images and Redshifts). However, the success of the method is strongly sensitive to our knowledge of the galaxy bias evolution in the source sample and we find that a percent level bias prior is needed to optimize the gains from the cross-correlation method (i.e., to approach the cosmology constraints attainable if the bias was known exactly).},

	Abstract = {Pan-STARRS1 has carried out a set of distinct synoptic imaging sky surveys including the $3\pi$ Steradian Survey and the Medium Deep Survey in 5 bands (\grizy). The mean 5$\sigma$ point source limiting sensitivities in the stacked 3$\pi$ Steradian Survey in \grizy are (23.3, 23.2, 23.1, 22.3, 21.4) respectively. The upper bound on the systematic uncertainty in the photometric calibration across the sky is 7-12 millimag depending on the bandpass. The systematic uncertainty of the astrometric calibration using the Gaia frame comes from a comparison of the results with Gaia: the standard deviation of the mean and median residuals ($ \Delta ra, \Delta dec $ ) are (2.3, 1.7) milliarcsec, and (3.1, 4.8) milliarcsec respectively. The Pan-STARRS system and the design of the PS1 surveys is described and an overview of the resulting image and catalog data products and their basic characteristics are described together with a summary of important results. The images, reduced data products, and derived data products from the Pan-STARRS1 surveys are available to the community from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at STScI.},

@article{nicola:2016,
	Abstract = {Recent progress in cosmology has relied on combining different cosmological probes. In earlier work, we implemented an integrated approach to cosmology where the probes are combined into a common framework at the map level. This has the advantage of taking full account of the correlations between the different probes, to provide a stringent test of systematics and of the validity of the cosmological model. We extend this analysis to include not only CMB temperature, galaxy clustering, weak lensing from SDSS but also CMB lensing, weak lensing from the DES SV survey, Type Ia SNe and $H_{0}$ measurements. This yields 12 auto and cross power spectra as well as background probes. Furthermore, we extend the treatment of systematic uncertainties. For $\Lambda$CDM, we find results that are consistent with our earlier work. Given our enlarged data set and systematics treatment, this confirms the robustness of our analysis and results. Furthermore, we find that our best-fit cosmological model gives a good fit to the data we consider with no signs of tensions within our analysis. We also find our constraints to be consistent with those found by WMAP9, SPT and ACT and the KiDS weak lensing survey. Comparing with the Planck Collaboration results, we see a broad agreement, but there are indications of a tension from the marginalized constraints in most pairs of cosmological parameters. Since our analysis includes CMB temperature Planck data at $10 < \ell < 610$, the tension appears to arise between the Planck high$-\ell$ and the other measurements. Furthermore, we find the constraints on the probe calibration parameters to be in agreement with expectations, showing that the data sets are mutually consistent. In particular, this yields a confirmation of the amplitude calibration of the weak lensing measurements from SDSS, DES SV and Planck CMB lensing from our integrated analysis. [abridged]},

	Abstract = {Super-sample covariance (SSC) is the dominant source of statistical error on large scale structure observables for both current and future galaxy surveys. In this work, we concentrate on the SSC of cluster counts, also known as sample variance, which is particularly useful for the self-calibration of the cluster observable-mass relation; our approach can similarly be applied to other observables, such as galaxy clustering and lensing shear. We first examine the accuracy of two analytical approximations proposed in the literature for the flat sky limit, finding that they are accurate respectively at the 15% and 30-35% level for covariances of counts in the same redshift bin. We then develop a harmonic expansion formalism that allows for the prediction of SSC in an arbitrary survey mask geometry, such as large sky areas of current and future surveys. We show analytically and numerically that this formalism recovers the full sky and flat sky limits present in the literature. We then present an efficient numerical implementation of the formalism, which allows fast and easy runs of covariance predictions when the survey mask is modified. We apply our method to a mask broadly similar to the Dark Energy Survey footprint, finding a non-negligible negative cross-z covariance, i.e. redshift bins are anti-correlated. We also examine the case of data removal from holes due e.g. to bright stars, quality cuts or systematic removals, and find that this does not have noticeable effects on the structure of the SSC matrix, only rescaling its amplitude by the effective survey area. These advances make possible for current and future galaxy surveys the computation of cosmology-dependent theoretical covariances, which can improve parameter constraints compared to methods that fix the covariance from data or simulations.},

	Abstract = {We forecast the main cosmological parameter constraints achievable with the CORE space mission which is dedicated to mapping the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). CORE was recently submitted in response to ESA's fifth call for medium-sized mission proposals (M5). Here we report the results from our pre-submission study of the impact of various instrumental options, in particular the telescope size and sensitivity level, and review the great, transformative potential of the mission as proposed. Specifically, we assess the impact on a broad range of fundamental parameters of our Universe as a function of the expected CMB characteristics, with other papers in the series focusing on controlling astrophysical and instrumental residual systematics. In this paper, we assume that only a few central CORE frequency channels are usable for our purpose, all others being devoted to the cleaning of astrophysical contaminants. On the theoretical side, we assume LCDM as our general framework and quantify the improvement provided by CORE over the current constraints from the Planck 2015 release. We also study the joint sensitivity of CORE and of future Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Large Scale Structure experiments like DESI and Euclid. Specific constraints on the physics of inflation are presented in another paper of the series. In addition to the six parameters of the base LCDM, which describe the matter content of a spatially flat universe with adiabatic and scalar primordial fluctuations from inflation, we derive the precision achievable on parameters like those describing curvature, neutrino physics, extra light relics, primordial helium abundance, dark matter annihilation, recombination physics, variation of fundamental constants, dark energy, modified gravity, reionization and cosmic birefringence.

	Abstract = {We present a method of calibrating the properties of photometric redshift bins as part of a larger Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for the inference of cosmological parameters. The redshift bins are characterised by their mean and variance, which are varied as free parameters and marginalised over when obtaining the cosmological parameters. We demonstrate that the likelihood function for cross-correlations in an angular power spectrum framework tightly constrains the properties of bins such that they may be well determined, reducing their influence on cosmological parameters and avoiding the bias from poorly estimated redshift distributions. We demonstrate that even with only three photometric and three spectroscopic bins, we can recover accurate estimates of the mean redshift of a bin to within $\Delta\mu \approx 3-4 \times10^{-3}$ and the width of the bin to $\Delta\sigma \approx 1\times10^{-3}$ for galaxies near $z = 1$. This indicates that we may be able to bring down the photometric redshift errors to a level which is in line with the requirements for the next generation of cosmological experiments.},

@article{desjacques:2016,
	Abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy (or halo) statistics. We then review the excursion set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.},

	Abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the BOSS CMASS sample using 250 square degrees of weak lensing data from CFHTLenS and CS82. We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogs trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two dimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40% larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of $S_{\rm 8}=\sigma_{\rm 8} \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ compared to Planck2015 reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement ($r<10$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos, and modifications to general relativity on $\Delta\Sigma$ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effects of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

	Abstract = {If the radio background is coming from cosmological sources, there should be some amount of clustering due to the large scale structure in the universe. Simple models for the expected clustering combined with the recent measurement by ARCADE-2 of the mean extragalactic temperature lead to predicted clustering levels that are substantially above upper limits from searches for anisotropy on arcminute scales using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Very Large Array. The rms temperature variations in the cosmic radio background appear to be more than a factor of 10 smaller (in temperature) than the fluctuations in the cosmic infrared background. It is therefore extremely unlikely that this background comes from galaxies, galaxy clusters, or any sources that trace dark matter halos at z <~ 5, unless typical sources are smooth on arcminute scales, requiring typical sizes of several Mpc.},

	Abstract = {On large scales, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) reflect not only the primordial density field but also the energy gain when photons traverse decaying gravitational potentials of large scale structure, what is called the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. Decomposing the anisotropy signal into a primordial piece and an ISW component, the main secondary effect on large scales, is more urgent than ever as cosmologists strive to understand the Universe on those scales. We present a likelihood technique for extracting the ISW signal combining measurements of the CMB, the distribution of galaxies, and maps of gravitational lensing. We test this technique with simulated data showing that we can successfully reconstruct the ISW map using all the data sets together. Then we present the ISW map obtained from a combination of real data: the NRAO VLA sky survey (NVSS) galaxy survey, temperature anisotropies, and lensing maps made by the Planck satellite. This map shows that, with the data sets used and assuming linear physics, there is no evidence, from the reconstructed ISW signal in the Cold Spot region, for an entirely ISW origin of this large scale anomaly in the CMB. However a large scale structure origin from low redshift voids outside the NVSS redshift range is still possible. Finally we show that future surveys, thanks to a better large scale lensing reconstruction will be able to improve the reconstruction signal to noise which is now mainly coming from galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {We study the random-walk problem on a deterministic scale-free network, in the presence of a set of static, identical targets; due to the strong inhomogeneity of the underlying structure the mean first-passage time (MFPT), meant as a measure of transport efficiency, is expected to depend sensitively on the position of targets. We consider several spatial arrangements for targets and we calculate, mainly rigorously, the related MFPT, where the average is taken over all possible starting points and over all possible paths. For all the cases studied, the MFPT asymptotically scales like  ˜Ntheta , being  N  the volume of the substrate and  theta  ranging from  1-log2/log3 , for central target(s), to 1, for a single peripheral target.},

	Abstract = {Lensing of the cosmic microwave background by modes that are larger than the size of the survey dilates intrinsic scales in the temperature and polarization fields and coherently shifts their observed power spectra with respect to the ensemble or all-sky mean. The effect can be simply encapsulated as a contribution to the power spectrum covariance matrix in accordance with the lensing trispectrum or as an additional parameter, the mean convergence in the field, for parameter estimation. It should be included for upcoming surveys that precisely measure acoustic polarization features deep into the damping tail at multipoles of l≳1500 with less than 10% of the sky. Its omission may lead to seemingly conflicting values for the angular scale of the sound horizon, which may then provide erroneous cosmological parameters when compared to baryon acoustic oscillation measurements.},

	Abstract = {Standard cosmological perturbation theory (SPT) for the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe fails at small scales (UV) due to strong nonlinearities and to multistreaming effects. In ref. [1] a new framework was proposed in which the large scales (IR) are treated perturbatively while the information on the UV, mainly small scale velocity dispersion, is obtained by nonlinear methods like N-body simulations. Here we develop this approach, showing that it is possible to reproduce the fully nonlinear power spectrum (PS) by combining a simple (and fast) 1-loop computation for the IR scales and the measurement of a single, dominant, correlator from N-body simulations for the UV ones. We measure this correlator for a suite of seven different cosmologies, and we show that its inclusion in our perturbation scheme reproduces the fully non-linear PS with percent level accuracy, for wave numbers up to k~ 0.4 h Mpc-1 down to 0z=. We then show that, once this correlator has been measured in a given cosmology, there is no need to run a new simulation for a different cosmology in the suite. Indeed, by rescaling this correlator by a proper function computable in SPT, the reconstruction procedure works also for the other cosmologies and for all redshifts, with comparable accuracy. Finally, we clarify the relation of this approach to the Effective Field Theory methods recently proposed in the LSS context.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation is entering a new era. Large collaborations need to coordinate high-stakes analyses using multiple methods; furthermore such analyses have grown in complexity due to sophisticated models of cosmology and systematic uncertainties. In this paper we argue that modularity is the key to addressing these challenges: calculations should be broken up into interchangeable modular units with inputs and outputs clearly defined. We present a new framework for cosmological parameter estimation, COSMOSIS, designed to connect together, share, and advance development of inference tools across the community. We describe the modules already available in COSMOSIS, including CAMB, PLANCK, cosmic shear calculations, and a suite of samplers. We illustrate it using demonstration code that you can run out-of-the-box with the installer available at http://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/cosmosis.},

	Abstract = {Planned cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will improve what we know about neutrino physics, inflation, and dark energy. The low level of noise, together with improved angular resolution, will increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the CMB polarized data as well as the reconstructed lensing potential of large scale structure. Projected constraints on cosmological parameters are tight, but these can be improved even further with information from external experiments. Here, we examine quantitatively the extent to which external priors can lead to improvement in projected constraints from a CMB-Stage IV (S4) experiment on neutrino and dark energy properties. We find that CMB S4 constraints on neutrino mass could be strongly enhanced by external constraints on the cold dark matter density Omegach2 and the Hubble constant H0. If polarization on the largest scales (l<50 ) will not be measured, an external prior on the primordial amplitude As or the optical depth tau will also be important. A CMB constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom, Neff, will benefit from an external prior on the spectral index ns and the baryon energy density Omegabh2. Finally, an external prior on H0 will help constrain the dark energy equation of state (w ).},

	Abstract = {A leading candidate source of detectable gravitational waves is the inspiral and merger of pairs of stellar-mass compact objects. The advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors will allow scientists to detect inspiral signals from more massive systems and at earlier times in the detector band, than with first generation detectors. The signal from a coalescence of two neutron stars is expected to stay in the sensitive band of advanced detectors for several minutes, thus allowing detection before the final coalescence of the system. In this work, the prospects of detecting inspiral signals prior to coalescence, and the possibility to derive a suitable sky area for source locations are investigated. As a large fraction of the signal is accumulated in the last ~10 seconds prior to coalescence, bandwidth and timing accuracy are largely accrued in the very last moments prior to coalescence. We use Monte Carlo techniques to estimate the accuracy of sky localization through networks of ground-based interferometers such as aLIGO and aVirgo. With the addition of the Japanese KAGRA detector, it is shown that the detection and triangulation before coalescence may be feasible.},

	Abstract = {Delensing is an increasingly important technique to reverse the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and thus reveal primordial signals the lensing may obscure. We present a first demonstration of delensing on Planck temperature maps using the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Reversing the lensing deflections in Planck CMB temperature maps using a linear combination of the 545 and 857GHz maps as a lensing tracer, we find that the lensing effects in the temperature power spectrum are reduced in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations. In particular, the characteristic sharpening of the acoustic peaks of the temperature power spectrum resulting from successful delensing is detected at a significance of 16$\rm{\sigma}$, with an amplitude of $A_{\rm{delens}} = 1.12 \pm 0.07$ relative to the expected value of unity. This first demonstration on data of CIB delensing, and of delensing techniques in general, is significant because lensing removal will soon be essential for achieving high-precision constraints on inflationary B-mode polarization.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the effect of unresolved point source contamination on estimates of the CMB lensing potential, from components such as the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, radio point sources, and the Cosmic Infrared Background. We classify the possible trispectra associated with such source populations, and construct estimators for the amplitude and scale-dependence of several of the major trispectra. We show how to propagate analytical models for these source trispectra to biases for lensing. We also construct a ``source-hardened'' lensing estimator which experiences significantly smaller biases when exposed to unresolved point sources than the standard quadratic lensing estimator. We demonstrate these ideas in practice using the sky simulations of Sehgal et al., for cosmic-variance limited experiments designed to mimic ACT, SPT, and Planck. We find that for radio sources and SZ the bias is significantly reduced, but for CIB it is essentially unchanged. However, by using the high-frequency, all-sky CIB measurements from Planck and Herschel it may be possible to suppress this contribution.},

The combination of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation feature measured from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and a Stage-IV Cosmic Microwave Background experiment has been forecasted to achieve $\sigma(M_\nu) < 1/3$ of the lower limit on $M_\nu$ from atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations \citep{2013arXiv1309.5383A,2012PhRvD..86a3012F}.

	Abstract = {We consider the shape of the likelihood and posterior surfaces to be used when fitting cosmological models to cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra measured from experiments. In the limit of an all-sky survey with Gaussian-distributed pixel noise we show that the true combined likelihood of the four CMB power spectra (TT, TE, EE and BB) has a Wishart distribution and we discuss the properties of this function. We compare various fits to the posterior surface of the Cl values, both in the case of a single auto-power spectrum and for a combination of temperature and polarization data. In the latter case, it is important that the fits can accurately match the Wishart distribution in the limit of near full-sky coverage. Simple extensions of auto-power spectrum fits to include polarization data generally fail to match correlations between the different power spectra in this limit. Directly fitting pixel values on large scales, as undertaken by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe team in their analysis of the 3-yr data, avoids the complications of characterizing the shape of the posterior for the power spectra. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the likelihood distribution on analytic marginalization, and provide a formula for analytic marginalization over a calibration error given an all-sky survey.},

@article{saito:2009,
	Abstract = {Future or ongoing galaxy redshift surveys can put stringent constraints on neutrinos masses via the high-precision measurements of galaxy power spectrum, when combined with CMB information. In this paper we develop a method to model galaxy power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear regime for a mixed dark matter [cold dark matter (CDM) plus finite-mass neutrinos] model, based on perturbation theory (PT) whose validity is well tested by simulations for a CDM model. In doing this we carefully study various aspects of the nonlinear clustering (nonlinear neutrino perturbations and the higher-order growth functions), and then arrive at a useful approximation allowing for a quick computation of the nonlinear power spectrum as in the CDM case. The nonlinear galaxy bias is also included in a self-consistent manner within the PT framework. Thus, the use of our PT model can give a more robust understanding of the measured galaxy power spectrum as well as allow for higher sensitivity to neutrino masses due to the gain of Fourier modes beyond the linear regime. Based on the Fisher matrix formalism, we find that the BOSS or Stage-III type survey, when combined with Planck CMB information, gives a precision of total neutrino mass constraint, sigma(mnu,tot)~=0.1eV, while the Stage-IV type survey may achieve sigma(mnu,tot)~=0.05eV, i.e., more than a 1-sigma detection of neutrino masses. We also discuss possible systematic errors on dark energy parameters caused by the neutrino mass uncertainty. The significant correlation between neutrino mass and dark energy parameters is found, if the information on power spectrum amplitude is included. More importantly, for the Stage-IV type survey, a best-fit dark energy model may be biased and falsely away from the underlying true model by more than the 1-sigma statistical errors, if neutrino mass is ignored in the model fitting.},

	Abstract = {Observations of neutrino oscillations show that neutrinos have mass. However, the best constraints on this mass currently come from cosmology, via measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. In this paper, we explore the prospects for using low-frequency radio observations of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization to further constrain neutrino masses. We use the Fisher matrix formalism to compare future galaxy surveys and 21 cm experiments. We show that by pushing to smaller scales and probing a considerably larger volume, 21 cm experiments can provide stronger constraints on neutrino masses than even very large galaxy surveys. Finally, we consider the possibility of going beyond measurements of the total neutrino mass to constraining the mass hierarchies. For a futuristic, 21 cm experiment we show that individual neutrino masses could be measured separately from the total neutrino mass.},

	Abstract = {The present experimental results on neutrino flavour oscillations provide evidence for non-zero neutrino masses, but give no hint on their absolute mass scale, which is the target of beta decay and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. Crucial complementary information on neutrino masses can be obtained from the analysis of data on cosmological observables, such as the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background or the distribution of large-scale structure. In this review we describe in detail how free-streaming massive neutrinos affect the evolution of cosmological perturbations. We summarize the current bounds on the sum of neutrino masses that can be derived from various combinations of cosmological data, including the most recent analysis by the WMAP team. We also discuss how future cosmological experiments are expected to be sensitive to neutrino masses well into the sub-eV range.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsic alignment (IA) of source galaxies is one of the major astrophysical systematics for ongoing and future weak lensing surveys. This paper presents the first forecasts of the impact of IA on cosmic shear measurements for current and future surveys (DES, Euclid, LSST, WFIRST) using simulated likelihood analyses and realistic covariances that include higher-order moments of the density field in the computation. We consider a range of possible IA scenarios and test mitigation schemes, which parameterize IA by the fraction of red galaxies, normalization, luminosity and redshift dependence of the IA signal (for a subset we consider joint IA and photo-z uncertainties). Compared to previous studies we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models if IA is ignored in the analysis; the amplitude and significance of these biases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical uncertainties), luminosity function, and IA scenario: Due to its small statistical errors and relatively shallow observing strategy Euclid is significantly impacted by IA. LSST and WFIRST benefit from their increased survey depth, while the larger statistical errors for DES decrease IA's relative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme removes parameter biases due to IA for DES, LSST, and WFIRST even if the shape of the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for Euclid requires more prior information. We explore several alternative IA mitigation strategies for Euclid; in the absence of alignment of blue galaxies we recommend the exclusion of red (IA contaminated) galaxies in cosmic shear analyses. We find that even a reduction of 20% in the number density of galaxies only leads to a 4-10% loss in cosmological constraining power.},

@article{planck-collaboration:2014b,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (l ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LambdaCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be theta* = (1.04147 $\pm$ 0.00062) × 10-2, Omegabh2 = 0.02205 $\pm$ 0.00028, Omegach2 = 0.1199 $\pm$ 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 $\pm$ 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 $\pm$ 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omegam = 0.315 $\pm$ 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter LambdaCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter LambdaCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 $\pm$ 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter LambdaCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ l ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of E-mode polarization and temperature-E-mode correlation in the cosmic microwave background using data from the first season of observations with SPTpol, the polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The observations used in this work cover 100 {{deg }2} of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz. We report the E-mode angular auto-power spectrum (EE) and the temperature-E-mode angular cross-power spectrum (TE) over the multipole range 500 < l <= 5000. These power spectra improve on previous measurements in the high-l (small-scale) regime. We fit the combination of the SPTpol power spectra, data from Planck, and previous SPT measurements with a six-parameter LambdaCDM cosmological model. We find that the best-fit parameters are consistent with previous results. The improvement in high-l sensitivity over previous measurements leads to a significant improvement in the limit on polarized point-source power: after masking sources brighter than 50 mJy in unpolarized flux at 150 GHz, we find a 95% confidence upper limit on unclustered point-source power in the EE spectrum of {{D}\ell }=\ell (\ell +1){{C}\ell }/2pi \lt 0.40 mu {{K}2} at \ell =3000, indicating that future EE measurements will not be limited by power from unclustered point sources in the multipole range \ell \lt 3600, and possibly much higher in \ell .},

	Abstract = {The Fisher Matrix is the backbone of modern cosmological forecasting. We describe the Fisher4Cast software: A general-purpose, easy-to-use, Fisher Matrix framework. It is open source, rigorously designed and tested and includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with automated LATEX file creation capability and point-and-click Fisher ellipse generation. Fisher4Cast was designed for ease of extension and, although written in Matlab, is easily portable to open-source alternatives such as Octave and Scilab. Here we use Fisher4Cast to present new 3D and 4D visualizations of the forecasting landscape and to investigate the effects of growth and curvature on future cosmological surveys. Early releases have been available at  since mid-2008. The current release of the code is Version 2.2 which is described here. For ease of reference a Quick Start guide and the code used to produce the figures in this paper are included, in the hope that it will be useful to the cosmology and wider scientific communities.},

	Abstract = {Temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are affected by the late integrated Sachs-Wolfe (lISW) effect caused by any time variation of the gravitational potential on linear scales. Dark energy is not the only source of lISW, since massive neutrinos induce a small decay of the potential on small scales during both matter and dark energy domination. In this work, we study the prospect of using the cross correlation between CMB and galaxy-density maps as a tool for constraining the neutrino mass. On the one hand massive neutrinos reduce the cross-correlation spectrum because free-streaming slows down structure formation; on the other hand, they enhance it through their change in the effective linear growth. We show that in the observable range of scales and redshifts, the first effect dominates, but the second one is not negligible. We carry out an error forecast analysis by fitting some mock data inspired by the Planck satellite, Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The inclusion of the cross correlation data from Planck and LSST increases the sensitivity to the neutrino mass mnu by 38% (and to the dark energy equation of state w by 83%) with respect to Planck alone. The correlation between Planck and DES brings a far less significant improvement. This method is not potentially as good for detecting mnu as the measurement of galaxy, cluster, or cosmic shear power spectra, but since it is independent and affected by different systematics, it remains potentially interesting if the total neutrino mass is of the order of 0.2 eV; if instead it is close to the lower bound from atmospheric oscillations, mnu˜0.05eV, we do not expect the ISW-galaxy correlation to be ever sensitive to mnu.},

	Abstract = {The recent BICEP2 measurement of excess B-mode polarization on large scales allows the possibility of measuring not only the amplitude of these fluctuations but also the scale dependence, which can be parametrized as the tensor spectral index. Measurements of this scale dependence will be hindered by the secondary B-mode polarization anisotropy induced by gravitational lensing. Fortunately, these contaminating B modes can be estimated and removed with a sufficiently good estimate of the intervening gravitational potential and a good map of CMB E-mode polarization. We present forecasts for how well these gravitational lensing B modes can be removed, assuming that the lensing potential can be estimated either internally from CMB data or using maps of the cosmic infrared background as a tracer. We find that maps of the cosmic infrared background are more effective for delensing at the noise levels of the current generation of CMB experiments, while the CMB maps themselves will ultimately be best for delensing when the experiments have sufficient sensitivity to measure the tensor spectral index to an accuracy of 0.02 or better. This level is particularly interesting, as it corresponds to the spectral index predicted by the consistency relation for single-field slow-roll models of inflation with r=0.2.},

	Abstract = {We develop a general method to `self-calibrate' observations of galaxy clustering with respect to systematics associated with photometric calibration errors. We first point out the danger posed by the multiplicative effect of calibration errors, where large-angle error propagates to small scales and may be significant even if the large-scale information is cleaned or not used in the cosmological analysis. We then propose a method to measure the arbitrary large-scale calibration errors and use these measurements to correct the small-scale (high-multipole) power which is most useful for constraining the majority of cosmological parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic examples and briefly discuss how it may be applied to real data.},

	Abstract = {Based on cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the 2013 Planck Mission data release, this paper presents the detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, that is, the correlation between the CMB and large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. The significance of detection ranges from 2 to 4sigma, depending on which method is used. We investigated three separate approaches, which essentially cover all previous studies, and also break new ground. (i) We correlated the CMB with the Planck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). This detection was made using the lensing-induced bispectrum between the low-l and high-l temperature anisotropies; the correlation between lensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5sigma. (ii) We cross-correlated with tracers of large-scale structure, which yielded a significance of about 3sigma, based on a combination of radio (NVSS) and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) We used aperture photometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known large-scale structures, which yielded and confirms a 4sigma signal, over a broader spectral range, when using a previously explored catalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale when compared with expectations. More recent catalogues give more moderate results that range from negligible to 2.5sigma at most, but have a more consistent scale and amplitude, the latter being still slightly higher than what is expected from numerical simulations within LambdaCMD. Where they can be compared, these measurements are compatible with previous work using data from WMAP, where these scales have been mapped to the limits of cosmic variance. Planck's broader frequency coverage allows for better foreground cleaning and confirms that the signal is achromatic, which makes it preferable for ISW detection. As a final step we used tracers of large-scale structure to filter the CMB data, from which we present maps of the ISW temperature perturbation. These results provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of a dark energy component that governs the currently accelerated expansion of the Universe.},

	Abstract = {On the arcminute angular scales probed by Planck, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies are gently perturbed by gravitational lensing. Here we present a detailed study of this effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217 GHz frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. We use thetemperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a (noisy) map of the CMB lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure of the mass distribution back to the CMB last-scattering surface. Our lensing potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale structure. We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding generally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting LambdaCDM model for the Planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z = 1100 correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures which source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power spectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter constraints; it improves CMB-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of large-scale polarization data. Discarding scale information, our measurement corresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power spectrum, or a 2% constraint on the root-mean-squared amplitude of matter fluctuations at z ~ 2.},

	Abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass M and SZ signal Y calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude sigma8 and matter density parameter Omegam in a flat LambdaCDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y-M relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that sigma8 = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.03, Omegam = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.02, and sigma8(Omegam/ 0.27)0.3 = 0.764 $\pm$ 0.025. The value of sigma8 is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20% (the central value from numerical simulations) we find sigma8(Omegam/0.27)0.3 = 0.78 $\pm$ 0.01 and a tighter one-dimensional range sigma8 = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.02. We find that the larger values of sigma8 and Omegam preferred by Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the LambdaCDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmologicalparameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make further progress in this field.},

@article{planck-collaboration:2014c,
	Abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the Planck satellite. The detailed results are based on studies of four independent estimates of the CMB that are compared to simulations using a fiducial LambdaCDM model and incorporating essential aspects of the Planck measurement process. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice, and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3sigma). However, we find little evidence of non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance in the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist on scales corresponding to about l = 600 and can be described in the low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence of a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

	Abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter LambdaCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations (sigma8) derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

	Abstract = {We examine the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) imprint of voids and superclusters on the cosmic microwave background. We first study results from the Jubilee N-body simulation. From Jubilee, we obtain the full-sky ISW signal from structures out to redshift z = 1.4 and a mock luminous red galaxy catalogue. We confirm that the expected signal in the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model is very small and likely to always be much smaller than the anisotropies arising at the last scattering surface. Any current detections of such an imprint must, therefore, predominantly arise from something other than an ISW effect in a LambdaCDM universe. Using the simulation as a guide, we then look for the signal using a catalogue of voids and superclusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a result that is consistent with the LambdaCDM model, i.e. a signal consistent with zero.},

	Abstract = {We test the statistical isotropy of the Universe by analysing the distribution of WISE extragalactic sources that were also observed by 2MASS. We pay particular attention to colour cuts and foreground marginalization in order to cull a uniform sample of extragalactic objects and avoid stars. We detect a dipole gradient in the number counts with an amplitude of ˜0.05, somewhat larger than expectations based on local structures corresponding to the depth and (independently measured) bias of our WISE-2MASS sources. The direction of the dipole, (l, b) ~= (310$\,^{\circ}$, -15$\,^{\circ}$), is in reasonably good agreement with that found previously in the (shallower) 2MASS Extended Source Catalog alone. Interestingly, the dipole direction is not far from the direction of the dipolar modulation in the cosmic microwave background found by Planck, and also fairly closely matches large-scale structure bulk-flow directions found by various groups using galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. It is difficult, however, to draw specific conclusions from the near-agreement of these directions.},

	Abstract = {The multi-frequency capability of the Planck satellite provides information both on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infrared background, or CIB) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensing effect on the cosmic microwave background, or CMB). The conjunction of these two unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark and luminous matter in the high redshift (1 <= z <= 3) Universe. We use a three-point statistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143, and 217 GHz, together with CIB measurements at 100-857 GHz. Following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite of consistency tests, we report the first detection of the correlation between the CIB and CMB lensing. The well matched redshift distribution of these two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42/19sigma (statistical/statistical + systematics) at 545 GHz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers. Our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both CIB auto- and CIB-lensing cross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with a characteristic mass scale for the halos hosting CIB sources of log10(M/M&sun;) = 10.5 $\pm$ 0.6. Leveraging the frequency dependence of our signal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the CIB, and constrain the star formation rate (SFR) density at z >= 1. We measure directly the SFR density with around 2sigma significance for three redshift bins between z = 1 and 7, thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at early times.},

	Abstract = {In addition to cosmological tests based on the mass function and clustering of galaxy clusters, which probe the growth of cosmic structure, nature offers two independent ways of using clusters to measure cosmic distances. The first uses measurements of the X-ray emitting gas mass fraction, which is an approximately standard quantity, independent of mass and redshift, for the most massive clusters. The second uses combined millimeter (mm) and X-ray measurements of cluster pressure profiles. We review these methods, their current status and the prospects for improvements over the next decade. For the first technique, which currently provides comparable dark energy constraints to type Ia supernova studies, improvements of a factor of 6 or more should be readily achievable, together with tight constraints on the mean matter density that are largely independent of the cosmological model assumed. Realizing this potential will require a coordinated, multiwavelength approach, utilizing new cluster surveys, X-ray, optical and mm facilities, and a continued emphasis on improved hydrodynamical simulations.},

	Abstract = {In this follow-up work to the high energy physics Community Summer Study 2013 (aka SNOWMASS), we explore the scientific capabilities of a future Stage IV cosmic microwave background polarization experiment under various assumptions on detector count, resolution, and sky coverage. We use the Fisher matrix technique to calculate the expected uncertainties of cosmological parameters in nuLambdaCDM that are especially relevant to the physics of fundamental interactions, including neutrino masses, effective number of relativistic species, dark energy equation of state, dark matter annihilation, and inflationary parameters. To further chart the landscape of future cosmology probes, we include forecasted results from the baryon acoustic oscillation signal as measured by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to constrain parameters that would benefit from low redshift information. We find the following best 1sigma constraints: sigma(M nu) = 15 meV, sigma(N eff) = 0.0156, dark energy figure of merit = 303, sigma(p ann) = 0.00588 × 3 × 10-26 cm3 s-1 GeV-1, sigma(Omega K ) = 0.00074, sigma(ns ) = 0.00110, sigma(alpha s ) = 0.00145, and sigma(r) = 0.00009. We also detail the dependencies of the parameter constraints on detector count, resolution, and sky coverage.},

	Abstract = {The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) measures the decay of the gravitational potential due to cosmic acceleration and is thus a direct probe of Dark Energy. In some of the earlier studies, the amplitude of the ISW effect was found to be in tension with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We measure the cross-power of galaxies and AGN from the WISE mission with CMB temperature data from WMAP9 in order to provide an independent measurement of the ISW amplitude. Cross-correlations with the recently released Planck lensing potential maps are used to calibrate the bias and contamination fraction of the sources, thus avoiding systematic effects that could be present when using auto-spectra to measure bias. We find an amplitude of the cross-power of $\mathcal{A} = 1.24\pm 0.47$ from the galaxies and $\mathcal{A} = 0.88 \pm 0.74$ from the AGN, fully consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction of $\mathcal{A} =1$. The ISW measurement signal-to-noise ratio is 2.7 and 1.2 respectively, giving a combined significance close to $3 \sigma$. Comparing the amplitudes of the galaxy and AGN cross-correlations, which arise from different redshifts, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in Dark Energy properties, consistent with a Cosmological Constant.},

	Abstract = {One of the primary scientific targets of current and future CMB polarization experiments is the search for a stochastic background of gravity waves in the early universe. As instrumental sensitivity improves, the limiting factor will eventually be B-mode power generated by gravitational lensing, which can be removed through use of so-called ``delensing'' algorithms. We forecast prospects for delensing using lensing maps which are obtained externally to CMB polarization: either from large-scale structure observations, or from high-resolution maps of CMB temperature. We conclude that the forecasts in either case are not encouraging, and that significantly delensing large-scale CMB polarization requires high-resolution polarization maps with sufficient sensitivity to measure the lensing B-mode. We also present a simple formalism for including delensing in CMB forecasts which is computationally fast and agrees well with Monte Carlos.},

	Abstract = {Szapudi et al (2001) introduced the method of estimating angular power spectrum of the CMB sky via heuristically weighted correlation functions. Part of the new technique is that all (co)variances are evaluated by massive Monte Carlo simulations, therefore a fast way to measure correlation functions in a high resolution map is essential. This letter presents a new algorithm to calculate pixel space correlation functions via fast spherical harmonics transforms. Our present implementation of the idea extracts correlations from a MAP-like CMB map (HEALPix resolution of 512, i.e. $ \simeq 3 \times 10^6$ pixels) in about 5 minutes on a 500MHz computer, including $C_\ell$ inversion; the analysis of one Planck-like map takes less then one hour. We use heuristic window and noise weighting in pixel space, and include the possibility of additional signal weighting as well, either in $\ell$ or pixel space. We apply the new code to an ensemble of MAP simulations, to test the response of our method to the inhomogenous sky coverage/noise of MAP. We show that the resulting $C_\ell$'s are very close to the theoretical expectations. The HEALPix based implementation of the method, SpICE (Spatially Inhomogenous Correlation Estimator) will be available to the public from the authors.},

	Abstract = {Future arcminute resolution polarization data from ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations can be used to estimate the contribution to the temperature power spectrum from the primary anisotropies and to uncover the signature of reionization near l=1500 in the small angular-scale temperature measurements. Our projections are based on combining expected small-scale E-mode polarization measurements from Advanced ACTPol in the range 300<l<3000 with simulated temperature data from the full Planck mission in the low and intermediate l region, 2<l<2000. We show that the six basic cosmological parameters determined from this combination of data will predict the underlying primordial temperature spectrum at high multipoles to better than 1% accuracy. Assuming an efficient cleaning from multi-frequency channels of most foregrounds in the temperature data, we investigate the sensitivity to the only residual secondary component, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) term. The CMB polarization is used to break degeneracies between primordial and secondary terms present in temperature and, in effect, to remove from the temperature data all but the residual kSZ term. We estimate a 15sigma detection of the diffuse homogeneous kSZ signal from expected AdvACT temperature data at l>1500, leading to a measurement of the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, sigma8, at 1% precision. Alternatively, by exploring the reionization signal encoded in the patchy kSZ measurements, we bound the time and duration of the reionization with sigma(zre)=1.1 and sigma(Deltazre)=0.2. We find that these constraints degrade rapidly with large beam sizes, which highlights the importance of arcminute-scale resolution for future CMB surveys.},

	Abstract = {We reassess the evidence that WMAP temperature maps contain a statistically significant ``cold spot'' by repeating the analysis using simple circular top-hat (disk) weights, as well as Gaussian weights of varying width. Contrary to previous results that used Spherical Mexican Hat Wavelets, we find no significant signal at any scale when we compare the coldest spot from our sky to ones from simulated Gaussian random, isotropic maps. We trace this apparent discrepancy to the fact that WMAP cold spot's temperature profile just happens to favor the particular profile given by the wavelet. Since randomly generated maps typically do not exhibit this coincidence, we conclude that the original cold spot significance originated at least partly due to a fortuitous choice of using a particular basis of weight functions. We also examine significance of a more general measure that returns the most significant result among several choices of the weighting function, angular scale of the spot, and the statistics applied, and again find a null result.},

	Abstract = {Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect can be estimated by cross-correlating the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky with tracers of the local matter distribution. At late cosmic time, the dark energy-induced decay of gravitation potential generates a cross correlation signal on large angular scales. The dominant noise is the intrinsic CMB anisotropies from the inflationary epoch. In this paper we use CMB polarization to reduce this intrinsic noise. We cross-correlate the microwave sky observed by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) with the radio source catalog compiled by NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) to study the efficiency of the noise suppression. We find that the error bars are reduced by about 4 to 14% and the statistical power in the signal is improved.},

	Abstract = {Standard inflationary hot big bang cosmology predicts small fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with isotropic Gaussian statistics. All measurements support the standard theory, except for a few anomalies discovered in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe maps and confirmed recently by the Planck satellite. The Cold Spot is one of the most significant of such anomalies, and the leading explanation of it posits a large void that imprints this extremely cold area via the linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect due to the decay of gravitational potentials over cosmic time, or via the Rees-Sciama (RS) effect due to late-time non-linear evolution. Despite several observational campaigns targeting the Cold Spot region, to date no suitably large void was found at higher redshifts $z > 0.3$. Here we report the detection of an $R =(192 \pm 15) h^{-1}Mpc$ size supervoid of depth $\delta = -0.13 \pm 0.03$, and centred at redshift $z = 0.22$. This supervoid, possibly the largest ever found, is large enough to significantly affect the CMB via the non-linear RS effect, as shown in our Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi framework. This discovery presents the first plausible explanation for any of the physical CMB anomalies, and raises the possibility that local large-scale structure could be responsible for other anomalies as well.},

	Abstract = {We detect a dip of 20%-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) sources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. The dip has structure on scales of ~1$\,^{\circ}$ to 10$\,^{\circ}$. Together with independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly nor a WMAP foreground-correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to explain the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single region. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds to the anomalies seen in the CMB.},

	Abstract = {We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l˜80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of ≈300 muKCMB&surd;s . BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations, and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LambdaCDM expectation in the range 30<l<150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of >5sigma. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. Cross correlating against WMAP 23 GHz maps we find that Galactic synchrotron makes a negligible contribution to the observed signal. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power ˜(5-10)× smaller than the observed excess signal (with no significant cross-correlation with our maps). However, these models are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with 3sigma significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring dust at 1.7sigma. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well fit by a lensed-LambdaCDM+tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar ratio r =0.20-0.05+0.07, with r=0 disfavored at 7.0sigma. Accounting for the contribution of foreground, dust will shift this value downward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.},

	Abstract = {This dissertation document details work completed in the field of cloud microphysical model error and uncertainty quantification. The general motivation is a need to account for error and uncertainty in microphysical parameterization schemes, which remain a large source numerical weather prediction error. The techniques used have been drawn from the fields of nonlinear parameter estimation, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification. First, microphysical parameter uncertainty has been quantified in a manner identical to that of Posselt and Vukicevic (2010), except that a vertically resolved simulated radar reflectivity observation was used as observation constraint on parameter uncertainty, rather than column-integral observations (such as IWP, LWP, etc.). This necessitated work on estimation of the error characteristic of the vertically resolved radar reflectivity observations, in particular, the estimation of a vertically correlated radar error model. Additionally, work has been conducted on estimating uncertainty in microphysics schemes by using perturbations on the hydrometeor time tendency equations as control parameters within a probabilistic Monte Carlo inversion. In order to further facilitate probabilistic inverse modeling studies, and to provide an educational tool for future students, a simplified, Matlab-based framework has been developed for testing advanced Monte Carlo techniques on simple models (e.g. damped harmonic oscillator, Lorenz 1963 model, etc). Finally, an ensemble Kalman transform smoother (EnTKS or ETKS, Posselt and Bishop (2012)) is used to confim that new choices of uncertain model control variables may aid in the use of ensemble Kalman techniques for non-Gaussain model uncertainty analysis},

	Abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of ``dark energy'' with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ``Stage IV'' dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

	Abstract = {We present initial results from the Jubilee Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) project, which models the expected Lambda cold dark matter ISW effect in the Jubilee simulation. The simulation volume is (6 h-1 Gpc)3, allowing power on very large scales to be incorporated into the calculation. Haloes are resolved down to a mass of 1.5 × 1012 h-1 M&sun;, which allows us to derive a catalogue of mock Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) for cross-correlation analysis with the ISW signal. We find the ISW effect observed on a projected sky to grow stronger at late times with the evolution of the ISW power spectrum matching expectations from linear theory. Maps of the gravitational-lensing effect are calculated using the same potential as for the ISW. We calculate the redshift dependence of the ISW-LRG cross-correlation signal for a full-sky survey with no noise considerations. For l < 30, the signal is strongest for lower redshift bins (z ˜ 0.2-0.5), whereas for l > 30, the signal is best observed with surveys covering z ˜ 0.6-1.0.},

@article{rassat:2013,
	Abstract = {Context. Although there is currently a debate over the significance of the claimed large-scale anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), their existence is not totally dismissed. In parallel to the debate over their statistical significance, recent work has also focussed on masks and secondary anisotropies as potential sources of these anomalies.  Aims: In this work we investigate simultaneously the impact of the method used to account for masked regions as well as the impact of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, which is the large-scale secondary anisotropy most likely to affect the CMB anomalies. In this sense, our work is an update of previous works. Our aim is to identify trends in CMB data from different years and with different mask treatments.  Methods: We reconstruct the ISW signal due to 2 Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) galaxies, effectively reconstructing the low-redshift ISW signal out to z ~ 1. We account for regions of missing data using the sparse inpainting technique. We test sparse inpainting of the CMB, large scale structure and ISW and find that it constitutes a bias-free reconstruction method suitable to study large-scale statistical isotropy and the ISW effect.  Results: We focus on three large-scale CMB anomalies: the low quadrupole, the quadrupole/octopole alignment, and the octopole planarity. After sparse inpainting, the low quadrupole becomes more anomalous, whilst the quadrupole/octopole alignment becomes less anomalous. The significance of the low quadrupole is unchanged after subtraction of the ISW effect, while the trend amongst the CMB maps is that both the low quadrupole and the quadrupole/octopole alignment have reduced significance, yet other hypotheses remain possible as well (e.g. exotic physics). Our results also suggest that both of these anomalies may be due to the quadrupole alone. While the octopole planarity significance is reduced after inpainting and after ISW subtraction, however, we do not find that it was very anomalous to start with.  In the spirit of participating in reproducible research, we make all codes and resulting products which constitute main results of this paper public here: http://www.cosmostat.org/anomaliesCMB.html},

	Abstract = {We investigate constraints on early dark energy (EDE) from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, taking into account data from WMAP9 combined with the latest small-scale measurements from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). For a constant EDE fraction we propose a new parametrization with one less parameter but still enough to provide similar results to the ones previously studied in the literature. The main emphasis of our analysis, however, compares a new set of different EDE parametrizations that reveal how CMB constraints depend on the redshift epoch at which dark energy was non-negligible. We find that bounds on EDE get substantially weaker if dark energy starts to be non-negligible later, with the early dark energy fraction Omegae free to go up to about 5% at two sigma if the onset of EDE happens at z≲100. Tight bounds around 1-2% are obtained whenever dark energy is present at last scattering, even if its effects switch off afterwards. We show that the CMB mainly constrains the presence of dark energy at the time of its emission, while EDE modifications of the subsequent growth of structure are less important.},

	Abstract = {Our peculiar motion with respect to the CMB rest frame represents a preferred direction in the observed CMB sky since it induces an apparent deflection of the observed CMB photons (aberration) and a shift in their frequency (Doppler). Both effects distort the multipoles alm's at all l's. Such effects are real as it has been recently measured for the first time by Planck according to what was forecast in some recent papers. However, the common lore when estimating a power spectrum from CMB is to consider that Doppler affects only the l = 1 multipole, neglecting any other corrections. In this work we use simulations of the CMB sky in a boosted frame with a peculiar velocity beta≡v/c = 1.23 × 10-3 in order to assess the impact of such effect on power spectrum estimations in different regions of the sky. We show that the boost induces a north-south asymmetry in the power spectrum which is highly significant and non-negligible, of about (0.58$\pm$0.10)% for half-sky cuts when going up to l ≈ 2500. We suggest that these effects are relevant and may account for some of the north-south asymmetries seen in the Planck data, being especially important at small scales. Finally we analyze the particular case of the ACT experiment, which observed only a small fraction of the sky and show that it suffers a bias of about 1% on the power spectrum and of similar size on some cosmological parameters: for example the position of the peaks shifts by 0.5% and the overall amplitude of the spectrum is about 0.4% lower than a full-sky case.},

	Abstract = {There is an approximately 9% discrepancy, corresponding to 2.4sigma, between two independent constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe: one indirectly arising from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations and one more directly obtained from local measurements of the relation between redshifts and distances to sources. We argue that by taking into account the local gravitational potential at the position of the observer this tension---strengthened by the recent Planck results---is partially relieved and the concordance of the Standard Model of cosmology increased. We estimate that measurements of the local Hubble constant are subject to a cosmic variance of about 2.4% (limiting the local sample to redshifts z>0.010) or 1.3% (limiting it to z>0.023), a more significant correction than that taken into account already. Nonetheless, we show that one would need a very rare fluctuation to fully explain the offset in the Hubble rates. If this tension is further strengthened, a cosmology beyond the Standard Model may prove necessary.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological models that invoke warm or cold dark matter cannot explain observed regularities in the properties of dwarf galaxies, their highly anisotropic spatial distributions, nor the correlation between observed mass discrepancies and acceleration. These problems with the standard model of cosmology have deep implications, in particular in combination with the observation that the data are excellently described by Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). MOND is a classical dynamics theory which explains the mass discrepancies in galactic systems, and in the universe at large, without invoking 'dark' entities. MOND introduces a new universal constant of nature with the dimensions of acceleration, a0, such that the pre-MONDian dynamics is valid for accelerations a ≫ a0, and the deep MONDian regime is obtained for a ≪ a0, where spacetime scale invariance is invoked. Remaining challenges for MOND are (i) explaining fully the observed mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters, and (ii) the development of a relativistic theory of MOND that will satisfactorily account for cosmology. The universal constant a0 turns out to have an intriguing connection with cosmology: a0 ≡ 2pia0 ≈ cH0 ≈ c2(Lambda/3)1/2. This may point to a deep connection between cosmology and internal dynamics of local systems.},

@article{khedekar:2013,
	Abstract = {We make the first detailed MCMC likelihood study of cosmological constraints that are expected from some of the largest, ongoing and proposed, cluster surveys in different wave-bands and compare the estimates to the prevalent Fisher matrix forecasts. Mock catalogs of cluster counts expected from the surveys --- eROSITA, WFXT, RCS2, DES and Planck, along with a mock dataset of follow-up mass calibrations are analyzed for this purpose. A fair agreement between MCMC and Fisher results is found only in the case of minimal models. However, for many cases, the marginalized constraints obtained from Fisher and MCMC methods can differ by factors of 30-100%. The discrepancy can be alarmingly large for a time dependent dark energy equation of state, w(a); the Fisher methods are seen to under-estimate the constraints by as much as a factor of 4-5. Typically, Fisher estimates become more and more inappropriate as we move away from LambdaCDM, to a constant-w dark energy to varying-w dark energy cosmologies. Fisher analysis, also, predicts incorrect parameter degeneracies. There are noticeable offsets in the likelihood contours obtained from Fisher methods that is caused due to an asymmetry in the posterior likelihood distribution as seen through a MCMC analysis. From the point of mass-calibration uncertainties, a high value of unknown scatter about the mean mass-observable relation, and its redshift dependence, is seen to have large degeneracies with the cosmological parameters sigma8 and w(a) and can degrade the cosmological constraints considerably. We find that the addition of mass-calibrated cluster datasets can improve dark energy and sigma8 constraints by factors of 2-3 from what can be obtained from CMB+SNe+BAO only . Finally, we show that a joint analysis of datasets of two (or more) different cluster surveys would significantly tighten cosmological constraints from using clusters only. Since, details of future cluster surveys are still being planned, we emphasize that optimal survey design must be done using MCMC analysis rather than Fisher forecasting.},

@article{gil-marin:2012,
	Abstract = {We investigate the accuracy of Eulerian perturbation theory for describing the matter and galaxy power spectra in real and redshift space in light of future observational probes for precision cosmology. Comparing the analytical results with a large suite of N-body simulations (160 independent boxes of 13.8 (Gpc/h)3 volume each, which are publicly available), we find that re-summing terms in the standard perturbative approach predicts the real-space matter power spectrum with an accuracy of lesssim2% for k <= 0.20 h/Mpc at redshifts zlesssim1.5. This is obtained following the widespread technique of writing the resummed propagator in terms of 1-loop contributions. We show that the accuracy of this scheme increases by considering higher-order terms in the resummed propagator. By combining resummed perturbation theories with several models for the mappings from real to redshift space discussed in the literature, the multipoles of the dark-matter power spectrum can be described with sub-percent deviations from N-body results for k <= 0.15 h/Mpc at zlesssim1. As a consequence, the logarithmic growth rate, f, can be recovered with sub-percent accuracy on these scales. Extending the models to massive dark-matter haloes in redshift space, our results describe the monopole term from N-body data within 2% accuracy for scales k <= 0.15 h/Mpc at zlesssim0.5; here f can be recovered within < 5% when the halo bias is known. We conclude that these techniques are suitable to extract cosmological information from future galaxy surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present the strongest robust constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) from currently available galaxy surveys, combining large-scale clustering measurements and their cross correlations with the cosmic microwave background. We update the data sets used by Giannantonio et al. (2012), and broaden that analysis to include the full set of two-point correlation functions between all surveys. In order to obtain the most reliable constraints on PNG, we advocate the use of the cross correlations between the catalogs as a robust estimator and we perform an extended analysis of the possible systematics to reduce their impact on the results. To minimize the impact of stellar contamination in our luminous red galaxy sample, we use the recent Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey catalog of Ross et al. (2011). We also find evidence for a new systematic in the NVSS radio galaxy survey similar to, but smaller than, the known declination-dependent issue; this is difficult to remove without affecting the inferred PNG signal, and thus we do not include the NVSS autocorrelation function in our analyses. We find no evidence of primordial non-Gaussianity; for the local-type configuration we obtain for the skewness parameter -36<fNL<45 at 95% C.L. (5$\pm$21 at 1sigma) when using the most conservative part of our data set, improving previous results; we also find no evidence for significant kurtosis, parameterized by gNL. In addition to PNG, we simultaneously constrain dark energy and find that it is required with a form consistent with a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {We show how the relativistic matter and velocity power spectra behave in different gauges. We construct a new gauge where both spectra coincide with Newtonian theory on all scales. However, in this gauge there are geometric quantities present which do not exist in Newtonian theory, for example the local variation of the Hubble parameter. Comparing this quantity to second-order Newtonian quantities, we find that Newtonian theory is inaccurate on scales larger than 10 Mpc. This stresses the importance of relativistic corrections to Newtonian cosmological N-body simulations on these scales.},

	Abstract = {We compute the matter bispectrum in the presence of primordial local non-Gaussianity over a wide range of scales, including the very small nonlinear ones. We use the Halo Model approach, considering non-Gaussian corrections to the halo profiles, the halo mass function and the bias functions. We compare our results in the linear and mildly nonlinear scales to a large ensemble of Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations. We consider both squeezed and equilateral configurations, at redshift z = 0 and z = 1. For z = 0, the deviations between the Halo Model and the simulations are smaller than 10% in the squeezed limit, both in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases. The Halo Model allows to make predictions on scales much smaller than those reached by numerical simulations. For local non-Gaussian initial conditions with a parameter fNL = 100, we find an enhancement of the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration k = k3 = k2 >> k1 ~ 0.01h-1Mpc, of ~ 15% and ~ 25% on scales k ~ 1h-1Mpc, at z = 0 and z = 1 respectively. This is mainly due to the non-Gaussian corrections in the linear bias. Finally we provide a very simple expression valid for any scenario, i.e. for any choice of the halo profile, mass and bias functions, which allow for a fast evaluation of the bispectrum on squeezed configurations.},

	Abstract = {Recent results of the ESA Planck satellite have confirmed the existence of some anomalies in the statistical distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. One of the most intriguing anomalies is the cold spot, first detected in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data by Vielva et al. In a later paper, Vielva et al. (2011) developed a method to probe the anomalous nature of the cold spot by using the cross-correlation of temperature and polarization of the CMB fluctuations. Whereas this work was built under the assumption of analysing full-sky data, in this paper we extend such approach to deal with realistic data sets with a partial-sky coverage. In particular, we exploit the radial and tangential polarization patterns around temperature spots. We explore the capacity of the method to distinguish between a standard Gaussian CMB scenario and an alternative one, in which the cold spot arises from a physical process that does not present correlated polarization features (e.g. topological defects), as a function of the instrumental-noise level. Moreover, we consider more in detail the case of an ideal noise-free experiment and the ones with the expected instrumental-noise levels in QUIJOTE and Planck experiments. We also present an application to the 9-year WMAP data, without being able to obtain firm conclusions, with a significance level of 32 per cent. In the ideal case, the alternative scenario could be rejected at a significance level of around 1 per cent, whereas for expected noise levels of QUIJOTE and Planck experiments the corresponding significance levels are 1.5 and 7.4 per cent, respectively.},

The mean and standard deviation of the six best-fit model deceleration-acceleration transition redshifts (for the three cosmological models and two Hubble constant priors we consider) are z da = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.05, in good agreement with the recent Busca et al. determination of z da = 0.82 $\pm$ 0.08 based on 11 H(z) measurements between redshifts 0.2 <= z <= 2.3, almost entirely from baryon-acoustic-oscillation-like data.},

	Abstract = {The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) have recently provided new, very precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy damping tail. The values of the cosmological parameters inferred from these measurements, while broadly consistent with the expectations of the standard cosmological model, are providing interesting possible indications for new physics that are definitely worthy of investigation. The ACT results, while compatible with the standard expectation of three-neutrino families, indicate a level of CMB lensing, parametrized by the lensing amplitude parameter AL, that is about 70% higher than expected. If not caused by an experimental systematic, an anomalous lensing amplitude could be produced by modifications of general relativity or coupled dark energy. Vice versa, the SPT experiment, while compatible with a standard level of CMB lensing, prefers an excess of dark radiation, parametrized by the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom Neff. Here we perform a new analysis of these experiments allowing simultaneous variations in both of these nonstandard parameters. We also combine these experiments, for the first time in the literature, with the recent WMAP9 data, one at a time. Including the Hubble Space Telescope prior on the Hubble constant and information from baryon acoustic oscillations surveys provides the following constraints from ACT: Neff=3.54$\pm$0.41, AL=1.64$\pm$0.32 at 68% C.L., while for SPT we have Neff=3.78$\pm$0.33, AL=0.79$\pm$0.11 at 68% C.L. In particular, the AL estimates from the two experiments, even when a variation in Neff is allowed, are in tension at more than 95% C.L.},

	Abstract = {We put forward and test a simple description of multipoint propagators (MP), which serve as building blocks to calculate the non-linear matter power spectrum. On large scales these propagators reduce to the well-known kernels in standard perturbation theory, while at smaller scales they are suppressed due to non-linear couplings. Through extensive testing with numerical simulations we find that this decay is characterized by the same damping scale for both two- and three-point propagators. In turn this transition can be well modelled with resummation results that exponentiate one-loop computations. For the first time, we measure the four components of the non-linear (two-point) propagator using dedicated simulations started from two independent random Gaussian fields for positions and velocities, verifying in detail the fundamentals of propagator resummation.  We use these results to develop an implementation of the MP expansion for the non-linear power spectrum that only requires seconds to evaluate at baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) scales. To test it we construct six suites of large numerical simulations with different cosmologies. From these and LASDAMAS runs we show that the non-linear power spectrum can be described at the ≲ 2 per cent level at BAO scales for redshifts in the range [0-2.5]. We make a public release of the MPTBREEZE code with the hope that it can be useful to the community.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of supernova light curves simulated for the upcoming Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova search. The simulations employ a code suite that generates and fits realistic light curves in order to obtain distance modulus/redshift pairs that are passed to a cosmology fitter. We investigated several different survey strategies including field selection, supernova selection biases, and photometric redshift measurements. Using the results of this study, we chose a 30 deg2 search area in the griz filter set. We forecast (1) that this survey will provide a homogeneous sample of up to 4000 Type Ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.05 <z < 1.2 and (2) that the increased red efficiency of the DES camera will significantly improve high-redshift color measurements. The redshift of each supernova with an identified host galaxy will be obtained from spectroscopic observations of the host. A supernova spectrum will be obtained for a subset of the sample, which will be utilized for control studies. In addition, we have investigated the use of combined photometric redshifts taking into account data from both the host and supernova. We have investigated and estimated the likely contamination from core-collapse supernovae based on photometric identification, and have found that a Type Ia supernova sample purity of up to 98% is obtainable given specific assumptions. Furthermore, we present systematic uncertainties due to sample purity, photometric calibration, dust extinction priors, filter-centroid shifts, and inter-calibration. We conclude by estimating the uncertainty on the cosmological parameters that will be measured from the DES supernova data.},

@article{baumann:2012,
	Abstract = {The universe is smooth on large scales but very inhomogeneous on small scales. Why is the spacetime on large scales modeled to a good approximation by the Friedmann equations? Are we sure that small-scale non-linearities do not induce a large backreaction? Related to this, what is the effective theory that describes the universe on large scales? In this paper we make progress in addressing these questions. We show that the effective theory for the long-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid coupled to gravity: integrating out short-wavelength perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous background and introduces dissipative dynamics into the evolution of long-wavelength perturbations. The effective fluid has small perturbations and is characterized by a few parameters like an equation of state, a sound speed and a viscosity parameter. These parameters can be matched to numerical simulations or fitted from observations. We find that the backreaction of small-scale non-linearities is very small, being suppressed by the large hierarchy between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon scale. The effective pressure of the fluid is always positive and much too small to significantly affect the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that virialized scales decouple completely from the large-scale dynamics, at all orders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our effective theory be used to formulate a well-defined and controlled alternative to conventional perturbation theory, and we discuss possible observational applications. Finally, our way of reformulating results in second-order perturbation theory in terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid provides the opportunity to understand non-linear effects in a simple and physically intuitive way.},

	Abstract = {Over the past few years much attention has been given to the study of modified gravity theories in order to find a more natural explanation for the late time acceleration of the Universe. Nevertheless, a comparison of the matter power spectrum predictions made by these theories with available data has not yet been subjected to a detailed analysis. In the context of f(R) theories of gravity we study the predicted power spectra using both a dynamical systems approach for the background and solving for the matter perturbations without using the quasistatic approximation, comparing the theoretical results with several Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. The importance of studying the first order perturbed equations by assuming the correct background evolution and the relevance of the initial conditions are also stressed. We determine the statistical significance in relation to the observational data and demonstrate their conflict with existing observations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, using and implementing a new line of sight CMB code, called CMBAns [1], that allows us to modify H(z) for any given feature at any redshift we study the effect of changes in the expansion history of the Universe on the CMB power spectrum. Motivated by the detailed analytical calculations of the effects of the changes in H(z) on ISW plateau and CMB low multipoles, we study two phenomenological parametric form of the expansion history using WMAP data and through MCMC analysis. Our MCMC analysis shows that the standard LambdaCDM cosmological model is consistent with the CMB data allowing the expansion history of the Universe vary around this model at different redshifts. However, our analysis also shows that a decaying dark energy model proposed in [2] has in fact a marginally better fit than the standard cosmological constant model to CMB data. Concordance of our studies here with the previous analysis showing that Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and supernovae data (SN Ia) also prefer mildly this decaying dark energy model to LambdaCDM, makes this finding interesting and worth further investigation.},

	Abstract = {If the entire post-inflationary patch is large compared to our Hubble volume even a small level of non-Gaussianity can cause statistics of the primordial curvature field in our Hubble volume to be biased by mode coupling. We explicitly compute the variation of locally measured statistics of the primordial curvature zeta from non-Gaussian mode coupling within a specific inflationary scenario: the curvaton model with a quadratic curvaton potential. This "super cosmic variance" is calculated in two ways: (i) as a super observer who has access to the curvature perturbation field across the entire post-inflationary patch and therefore sees local statistics as biased by mode coupling and (ii) as a local observer who sees the statistics of zeta determined by the local values of quantities in their Hubble patch. The two calculations agree and show that in the quadratic curvaton model patch-to-patch differences in statistics of zeta can be interpreted entirely as a shift in the value of the curvaton field at freeze out. Applying the same arguments to single-field slow-roll inflation gives a simple picture of how non-Gaussian mode coupling between the curvature perturbations on very different physical scales must vanish in the attractor limit.},

	Abstract = {The adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. We study deviations from the expected adiabatic evolution of the CMB temperature of the form T(z) = T0(1 + z)1 - alpha using measurements of the spectrum of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with the South Pole Telescope (SPT). We present a method for using the ratio of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 GHz in the SPT data to constrain the temperature of the CMB. We demonstrate that this approach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from a new set of hydrodynamical simulations. We apply this method to a sample of 158 SPT-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range 0.05 < z < 1.35, and measure alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}, consistent with the standard model prediction of alpha = 0. In combination with other published results, we find alpha = 0.005 $\pm$ 0.012, an improvement of ˜10 per cent over published constraints. This measurement also provides a strong constraint on the effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy weff = -0.994 $\pm$ 0.010.},

	Abstract = {Scalar fields with inverse power-law effective potentials may provide a negative pressure component to the energy density of the universe today, as required by cosmological observations. In order to be cosmologically relevant today, the scalar field should have a mass mphi=O(10-33 eV), thus potentially inducing sizable violations of the equivalence principle and space-time variations of the coupling constants. Scalar-tensor theories of gravity provide a framework for accommodating phenomenologically acceptable ultralight scalar fields. We discuss nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theories in which the scalar-matter coupling is a dynamical quantity. Two attractor mechanisms are operative at the same time: one towards the tracker solution, which accounts for the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and one towards general relativity, which makes the ultralight scalar field phenomenologically safe today. As in usual tracker-field models, the late-time behavior is largely independent of the initial conditions. Strong distortions in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectra as well as in the matter power spectrum are expected.},

	Abstract = {We show with analytic models that the assumption of uncorrelated intrinsic ellipticities of target sources that is usually made in searches for weak gravitational lensing arising from large-scale mass inhomogeneities (`field lensing') is unwarranted. If the orientation of the galaxy image is determined either by the angular momentum or by the shape of the halo in which it forms, then the image should be aligned preferentially with the component of the tidal gravitational field perpendicular to the line of sight. Long-range correlations in the tidal field will thus lead to long-range ellipticity-ellipticity correlations that mimic the shear correlations arising from weak gravitational lensing. We calculate the ellipticity-ellipticity correlation expected if halo shapes determine the observed galaxy shape, and we discuss uncertainties (which are still considerable) in the predicted amplitude of this correlation. The ellipticity-ellipticity correlation induced by angular momenta should be smaller. We consider several methods for discriminating between the weak-lensing (extrinsic) and intrinsic correlations, including the use of redshift information. An ellipticity-tidal-field correlation also implies the existence of an alignment of images of galaxies near clusters. Although the intrinsic alignment may complicate the interpretation of field-lensing results, it is inherently interesting as it may shed light on galaxy formation as well as on structure formation.},

	Abstract = {The Cold Spot is one of the anomalies in the Cosmic Microwave Background, and could be of primordial origin, or caused by a foreground structure. The recently constructed WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared catalogue has a projected underdensity in the direction of the Cold Spot with an angular size 10's of degrees, and as deep as $\delta\simeq -0.12$ in the center. We show that a spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) void model can simultaneously fit the underdensity in the WISE-2MASS catalogue and the Cold Spot as observed by both the Wilkinson Anisotropy Probe and Planck satellites. Such an LTB supervoid gives a perfect explanation, via a Rees-Sciama effect, of the Cold Spot anomaly, and is strongly preferred (using a Bayesian analysis) over the null hypothesis (statistical fluctuation) or a texture model. When the galaxy bias, measured from the large-scale angular power spectrum, is taken into account, a simultaneous three-parameter fit for the void model and the temperature profile gives $z_0 = 0.16 \pm 0.04$ for the mean redshift of the supervoid, $r_0 = 195 \pm 35 \,h^{-1}$Mpc for its size, and $\bar\delta = - 0.10 \pm 0.03$ for the top-hat-projected average depth of the void. These parameters are in excellent agreement with the results of \cite{SzapudiEtal2014}, who used additional photometric redshifts from Pan-STARRS1 for direct tomographic imaging of the void.},

	Abstract = {We use the WISE-2MASS infrared galaxy catalog matched with Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) galaxies to search for a supervoid in the direction of the Cosmic Microwave Background Cold Spot. Our imaging catalog has median redshift $z\simeq 0.14$, and we obtain photometric redshifts from PS1 optical colours to create a tomographic map of the galaxy distribution. The radial profile centred on the Cold Spot shows a large low density region, extending over 10's of degrees. Motivated by previous Cosmic Microwave Background results, we test for underdensities within two angular radii, $5^\circ$, and $15^\circ$. The counts in photometric redshift bins show significantly low densities at high significance, $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ and $\gtrsim 6 \sigma$, respectively, for the two fiducial radii. The line-of-sight position of the deepest region of the void is $z\simeq 0.15-0.25$. Our data, combined with an earlier measurement by Granett et al. (2010), are consistent with a large $R_{void}=(192 \pm 15)h^{-1}Mpc~(2\sigma)$ supervoid with $\delta \simeq -0.13 \pm 0.03$ centered at $z=0.22\pm0.01$. Such a supervoid, constituting a $\simeq 3.5-5 \sigma$ fluctuation in a Gaussian distribution of the $\Lambda CDM$ model, is a plausible cause for the Cold Spot.},

@article{das:2014,
	Abstract = {Recent results of Planck data reveal that the power [1,2] in the low multipoles of the CMB angular power spectrum, approximately up to l = 30, is significantly lower than the theoretically predicted in the best fit LambdaCDM model. There are different known physical effects that can affect the power at low multipoles, such as features in the primordial power spectrum (PPS) in some models of inflation and ISW effect. In this paper we investigate the possibility of invoking the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect to explain the power deficit at low multipoles. The ISW effect that originates from the late time expansion history of the universe is rich in possibilities given the limited understanding of the origin of dark energy (DE). It is a common understanding that the ISW effect adds to the power at the low multipoles of the CMB angular power spectrum. In this paper we carry out an analytic study to show that there are some expansion histories in which the ISW effect, instead of adding power, provides negative contribution to the power at low multipoles. Guided by the analytic study, we present examples of the features required in the late time expansion history of the universe that could explain the power deficiency through the ISW effect. We also show that an ISW origin of power deficiency is consistent, at present, with other cosmological observations that probe the expansion history such as distance modulus, matter power spectrum and the evolution of cluster number count. We also show that the ISW effect may be distinguished from power deficit originating from features in the PPS using the measurements of the CMB polarization spectrum at low multipoles expected from Planck. We conclude that the power at low multipoles of the CMB anisotropy could well be closely linked to Dark Energy puzzle in cosmology and this observation could be actually pointing to richer phenomenology of DE beyond the cosmological constant Lambda.},

	Abstract = {The Planck CMB experiment has delivered the best constraints so far on primordial non-Gaussianity, ruling out early-Universe models of inflation that generate large non-Gaussianity. Although small improvements in the CMB constraints are expected, the next frontier of precision will come from future large-scale surveys of the galaxy distribution. The advantage of such surveys is that they can measure many more modes than the CMB -- in particular, forthcoming radio surveys with the SKA will cover huge volumes. Radio continuum surveys deliver the largest volumes, but with the disadvantage of no redshift information. In order to mitigate this, we use two additional observables. First, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect -- the cross-correlation of the radio number counts with the CMB temperature anisotropies -- helps to reduce systematics on the large scales that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity. Second, optical data allows for cross-identification in order to gain some redshift information. We show that, while the single redshift bin case can provide a sigma(fNL) ~ 20, and is therefore not competitive with current and future constraints on non-Gaussianity, a tomographic analysis could improve the constraints by an order of magnitude, even with only two redshift bins. A huge improvement is provided by the addition of high-redshift sources, so having cross-ID for high-z galaxies and an even higher-z radio tail is key to enabling very precise measurements of fNL. Our results show that SKA continuum surveys could provide constraints competitive with CMB and forthcoming optical surveys, potentially allowing a measurement of sigma(fNL) ~ 1 to be made. Moreover, these measurements would act as a useful check of results obtained with other probes at other redshift ranges with other methods.},

@article{planck-collaboration:2013d,
	Abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

	Abstract = {In models with a cosmological constant a significant component of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy is produced at rather low redshifts z<~1. In these models, the gravitational potential perturbations begin to evolve at late times, shifting the frequencies of photons passing though them. Since the potential reflects the matter density, the latter should be correlated with the CMB anisotropy. We examine this correlation and discuss the prospects for using an x-ray/COBE comparison to detect a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {A simple six-parameter LambdaCDM model provides a successful fit to WMAP data. This holds both when the WMAP data are analyzed alone or in combination with other cosmological data. Even so, it is appropriate to examine the data carefully to search for hints of deviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation, dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. The cosmological community has subjected the WMAP data to extensive and varied analyses. While there is widespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter LambdaCDM model, various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. In this paper we examine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of their significance. In most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posterior selection of some aspect or subset of the data. Compared with sky simulations based on the best-fit model, one can select for low probability features of the WMAP data. Low probability features are expected, but it is not usually straightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature is the result of the a posteriori selection or non-standard cosmology. Hypothesis testing could, of course, always reveal an alternative model that is statistically favored, but there is currently no model that is more compelling. We find that two cold spots in the map are statistically consistent with random cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. We also find that the amplitude of the quadrupole is well within the expected 95% confidence range and therefore is not anomalously low. We find no significant anomaly with a lack of large angular scale CMB power for the best-fit LambdaCDM model. We examine in detail the properties of the power spectrum data with respect to the LambdaCDM model and find no significant anomalies. The quadrupole and octupole components of the CMB sky are remarkably aligned, but we find that this is not due to any single map feature; it results from the statistical combination of the full-sky anisotropy fluctuations. It may be due, in part, to chance alignments between the primary and secondary anisotropy, but this only shifts the coincidence from within the last scattering surface to between it and the local matter density distribution. While this alignment appears to be remarkable, there was no model that predicted it, nor has there been a model that provides a compelling retrodiction. We examine claims of a hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry across the sky and find that the evidence for these claims is not statistically significant. We confirm the claim of a strong quadrupolar power asymmetry effect, but there is considerable evidence that the effect is not cosmological. The likely explanation is an insufficient handling of beam asymmetries. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for deviations from the LambdaCDM model, which is generally an acceptable statistical fit to WMAP and other cosmological data.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {We consider the issue of hemispherical power asymmetry in the third-year WMAP data, adopting a previously introduced modulation framework. Computing both frequentist probabilities and Bayesian evidences, we find that the model consisting of an isotropic CMB sky modulated by a dipole field gives a substantially better fit to the observations than the purely isotropic model, even when accounting for the larger prior volume. For the ILC map, the Bayesian log-evidence difference is ~1.8 in favor of the modulated model, and the raw improvement in maximum log likelihood is 6.1. The best-fit modulation dipole axis points toward (l, b) = (225$\,^{\circ}$, -27$\,^{\circ}$), and the modulation amplitude is 0.114, in excellent agreement with the results from the first-year analyses. The frequentist probability of obtaining such a high modulation amplitude in an isotropic universe is ~1%. These results are not sensitive to data set or sky cut. Thus, the statistical evidence for a power asymmetry anomaly is both substantial and robust, although not decisive, for the currently available data. Increased sky coverage through better foreground handling and full-sky and high-sensitivity polarization maps may shed further light on this issue.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated non-Gaussianity of our early universe by comparing the parity asymmetry of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) power spectrum with simulations. We find that odd-parity preference of the WMAP data (2 <= l <= 18) is anomalous at 4-in-1000 level. We find it likely that low quadrupole power is part of this parity asymmetry rather than an isolated anomaly. Further investigation is required to find out whether the origin of this anomaly is a cosmological or a systematic effect. The data from Planck Surveyor, which has systematics distinct from WMAP, will help us to resolve the origin of the anomalous odd-parity preference.},

@article{vielva:2004,
	Abstract = {A non-Gaussian detection in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year data is reported. The detection has been found in the combined Q-V-W map proposed by the WMAP team after applying a wavelet technique based on the spherical Mexican hat wavelet (SMHW). The skewness and the kurtosis of the SMHW coefficients are calculated at different scales (ranging from a few arcminutes to tens of degrees). A non-Gaussian signal is detected at scales of the SMHW around 4deg (size in the sky of around 10deg). The right-tail probability of the detection is ~0.4%. In addition, a study of Gaussianity is performed in each hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is compatible with Gaussianity, whereas the southern one deviates from Gaussianity with a right-tail probability of ~0.1%. Systematics, foregrounds, and uncertainties in the estimation of the cosmological parameters are carefully studied in order to identify the possible source of non-Gaussianity. The detected deviation from Gaussianity is not found to be caused by systematic effects: (1) Each one of the Q, V, and W receivers shows the same non-Gaussianity pattern. (2) Several combinations of the different receivers at each frequency band-which highly reduce the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the foreground emissions-do not show this non-Gaussian pattern. Similarly, Galactic foregrounds show a negligible contribution to the non-Gaussian detection: non-Gaussianity is detected in all the WMAP maps (from 23 to 94 GHz), and no frequency dependence is observed. Moreover, the expected foreground contribution to the combined WMAP map was added to CMB Gaussian simulations showing a behavior compatible with the Gaussian model. The influence of uncertainties in the CMB power spectrum estimation are also quantified. Hence, possible intrinsic temperature fluctuations (such as secondary anisotropies and primordial features) cannot be rejected as the source of this non-Gaussian detection. We remark that our result implies not only asymmetries north/south-like other previous WMAP analyses-but also a direct non-Gaussian detection.},

	Abstract = {We investigate anomalies reported in the cosmic microwave background maps from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite on very large angular scales and discuss possible interpretations. Three independent anomalies involve the quadrupole and octopole: (1) The cosmic quadrupole on its own is anomalous at the 1-in-20 level by being low (the cut-sky quadrupole measured by the WMAP team is more strikingly low, apparently due to a coincidence in the orientation of our Galaxy of no cosmological significance); (2) the cosmic octopole on its own is anomalous at the 1-in-20 level by being very planar; (3) the alignment between the quadrupole and octopole is anomalous at the 1-in-66 level. Although the a priori chance of all three occurring is 1 in 24000, the multitude of alternative anomalies one could have looked for dilutes the significance of such a posteriori statistics. The simplest small universe model where the universe has toroidal topology with one small dimension of order one-half the horizon scale, in the direction toward Virgo, could explain the three items above. However, we rule this model out using two topological tests: the S statistic and the matched circle test.},

	Abstract = {The non-Gaussian cold spot detected in wavelet space in the WMAP 1 yr data is detected again in the co-added WMAP 3 yr data at the same position (b=-57deg, l=209deg) and size in the sky (~10$\,^{\circ}$). The present analysis is based on several statistical methods: kurtosis, maximum absolute temperature, number of pixels below a given threshold, volume, and higher criticism. All these methods detect deviations from Gaussianity in the 3 yr data set at a slightly higher confidence level than in the WMAP 1 yr data. These small differences are mainly due to the new foreground reduction technique and not to the reduction of the noise level, which is negligible at the scale of the spot. In order to avoid a posteriori analyses, we recalculate for the WMAP 3 yr data the significance of the deviation in the kurtosis. The skewness and kurtosis tests were the first tests performed with wavelets for the WMAP data. We obtain that the probability of finding an at least as high deviation in Gaussian simulations is 1.85%. The frequency dependence of the spot is shown to be extremely flat. Galactic foreground emissions are not likely to be responsible for the detected deviation from Gaussianity.},

	Abstract = {An extremely cold and big spot in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 1-yr data is analysed. Our work is a continuation of a previous paper by Vielva et al. that reported the detection of non-Gaussianity, with a method based on the spherical Mexican hat wavelet (SMHW) technique. We study the spots at different thresholds on the SMHW coefficient maps, considering six estimators, namely the number of maxima, the number of minima, the numbers of hot and cold spots, and the number of pixels of those spots. At SMHW scales around 4$\,^{\circ}$ (10$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky), the data deviate from Gaussianity. The analysis is performed on all of the sky, the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and on four regions covering all of the sky. A cold spot at (b=-57$\,^{\circ}$,l= 209$\,^{\circ}$) is found to be the source of this non-Gaussian signature. We compare the spots of our data with 10000 Gaussian simulations, and conclude that only around 0.2 per cent of them present such a cold spot. Excluding this spot, the remaining map is compatible with Gaussianity, and even the excess of kurtosis in the paper by Vielva et al. is found to be due exclusively to this spot. Finally, we study whether the spot causing the observed deviation from Gaussianity could be generated by systematics or foregrounds. None of them seem to be responsible for the non-Gaussian detection.},

	Abstract = {We construct a map of the time derivative of the gravitational potential traced by Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxies (LRGs). The potential decays on large scales due to cosmic acceleration, leaving an imprint on cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. With a template fit, we directly measure this signature on the CMB at a 2sigma confidence level. The measurement is consistent with the cross-correlation statistic, strengthening the claim that dark energy is indeed the cause of the correlation. This new approach potentially simplifies the cosmological interpretation. Our constructed linear ISW map shows no evidence for degree-scale cold and hot spots associated with supervoid and supercluster structures. This suggests that the linear ISW effect in a concordance LambdaCDM cosmology is insufficient to explain the strong CMB imprints from these structures that we previously reported.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we rely on the quasar (QSO) catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Six (SDSS DR6) of about one million photometrically selected QSOs to compute the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect at high redshift, aiming at constraining the behavior of the expansion rate and thus the behaviour of dark energy at those epochs. This unique sample significantly extends previous catalogs to higher redshifts while retaining high efficiency in the selection algorithm. We compute the auto-correlation function (ACF) of QSO number density from which we extract the bias and the stellar contamination. We then calculate the cross-correlation function (CCF) between QSO number density and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations in different subsamples: at high z>1.5 and low z<1.5 redshifts and for two different choices of QSO in a conservative and in a more speculative analysis. We find an overall evidence for a cross-correlation different from zero at the 2.7\sigma level, while this evidence drops to 1.5\sigma at z>1.5. We focus on the capabilities of the ISW to constrain the behaviour of the dark energy component at high redshift both in the \LambdaCDM and Early Dark Energy cosmologies, when the dark energy is substantially unconstrained by observations. At present, the inclusion of the ISW data results in a poor improvement compared to the obtained constraints from other cosmological datasets. We study the capabilities of future high-redshift QSO survey and find that the ISW signal can improve the constraints on the most important cosmological parameters derived from Planck CMB data, including the high redshift dark energy abundance, by a factor \sim 1.5.},

	Abstract = {One of the main challenges of modern cosmology is to understand the nature of dark energy. The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is sensitive to dark energy and presents an independent signature of dark energy in the absence of modified gravity and curvature. The ISW effect occurs on large scales, where cosmic variance is high and where there are large amounts of missing data in the CMB and large scale structure maps due to Galactic confusion. Moreover, existing methods in the literature often make strong assumptions about the statistics of the underlying fields or estimators. Together these effects can severely limit signal extraction. We review literature on the ISW effect, comparing statistical subtleties between existing methods, and identifying several limitations. We propose a novel method to detect and measure the ISW signal. This method assumes only that the primordial CMB field is Gaussian. It is based on a sparse inpainting method to reconstruct missing data and uses a bootstrap technique to avoid assumptions about the statistics of the estimator. It is a complete method, using three complementary statistical methods. We apply our method to Euclid-like simulations and show we can expect a \sim 7\sigma model-independent detection of the ISW signal with WMAP7-like data, even with missing data. Other tests return \sim 4.7\sigma detection levels for a Euclid-like survey, with levels independent from whether the galaxy field is normally or lognormally distributed. We apply our method to the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and WMAP7 CMB data and find detections in the 1.1 - 2.0\sigma range, as expected from simulations. As a by-product, we reconstruct the full-sky temperature ISW field due to 2MASS data. We have presented a novel technique, based on sparse inpainting and bootstrapping, which accurately detects and reconstructs the ISW effect.},

	Abstract = {Topic of this article are tomographic measurements of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect with specifically designed, orthogonal polynomials which project out statistically independent modes of the galaxy distribution. The polynomials are contructed using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation method. To quantify the power of the iSW-effect in contraining cosmological parameters we perfom a combined Fisher matrix analysis for the iSW-, galaxy- and cross-spectra for wCDM cosmologies using the survey characteristics of PLANCK and EUCLID. The signal to noise ratio has also been studied for other contemporary galaxy surveys, such as SDSS, NVSS and 2MASS. For the cross-spectra our tomographic method provides a 16% increase in the signal to noise ratio and an improvement of up to 30% in conditional errors on parameters. Including all spectra, the marginalised errors approach an inverse square-root dependence with increasing cumulative polynomial order which underlines the statistical independence of the weighted signal spectra.},

	Abstract = {The Combined EIS-NVSS Survey Of Radio Sources (CENSORS) is a 1.4-GHz radio survey selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and complete to a flux density of 7.2mJy. It targets the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) Patch D, which is a 3 × 2-deg2 field centred on (J2000). This paper presents the results of spectroscopic observations of 143 of the 150 CENSORS sources. The primary motivation for these observations is to achieve sufficient spectroscopic completeness so that the sample may be used to investigate the evolution of radio sources.  The observations result in secure spectroscopic redshifts for 63 per cent of the sample and likely redshifts (based on a single emission line, for example) for a further 8 per cent. Following the identification of the quasars and star-forming galaxies in the CENSORS sample, estimated redshifts are calculated for the remainder of the sample via the K - z relation for radio galaxies.  Comparison of the redshift distribution of the CENSORS radio sources to distributions predicted by the various radio luminosity function evolution models of Dunlop & Peacock, results in no good match. This demonstrates that this sample can be used to expand upon previous work in that field.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the microwave background by the intervening dark matter mainly arises from large-angle fluctuations in the projected gravitational potential and hence offers a unique opportunity to study the physics of the dark sector at large scales. Studies with surveys that cover greater than a percent of the sky will require techniques that incorporate the curvature of the sky. We lay the groundwork for these studies by deriving the full sky minimum variance quadratic estimators of the lensing potential from the CMB temperature and polarization fields. We also present a general technique for constructing these estimators, with harmonic space convolutions replaced by real space products, that is appropriate for both the full sky limit and the flat sky approximation. This also extends previous treatments to include estimators involving the temperature-polarization cross-correlation and should be useful for next generation experiments in which most of the additional information from polarization comes from this channel due to sensitivity limitations.},

	Abstract = {Large sets of objects with spectroscopic redshift measurements will be needed for imaging dark energy experiments to achieve their full potential, serving two goals:_training_, i.e., the use of objects with known redshift to develop and optimize photometric redshift algorithms; and_calibration_, i.e., the characterization of moments of redshift (or photo-z error) distributions. Better training makes cosmological constraints from a given experiment stronger, while highly-accurate calibration is needed for photo-z systematics not to dominate errors. In this white paper, we investigate the required scope of spectroscopic datasets which can serve both these purposes for ongoing and next-generation dark energy experiments, as well as the time required to obtain such data with instruments available in the next decade. Large time allocations on kilo-object spectrographs will be necessary, ideally augmented by infrared spectroscopy from space. Alternatively, precision calibrations could be obtained by measuring cross-correlation statistics using samples of bright objects from a large baryon acoustic oscillation experiment such as DESI. We also summarize the additional work on photometric redshift methods needed to prepare for ongoing and future dark energy experiments.},

	Abstract = {Fluctuations in the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe each contain clues about the nature of the earliest moments of time. The next generation of CMB and large-scale structure (LSS) experiments are poised to test the leading paradigm for these earliest moments---the theory of cosmic inflation---and to detect the imprints of the inflationary epoch, thereby dramatically increasing our understanding of fundamental physics and the early universe. A future CMB experiment with sufficient angular resolution and frequency coverage that surveys at least 1% of the sky to a depth of 1 uK-arcmin can deliver a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio that will either result in a 5-sigma measurement of the energy scale of inflation or rule out all large-field inflation models, even in the presence of foregrounds and the gravitational lensing B-mode signal. LSS experiments, particularly spectroscopic surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, will complement the CMB effort by improving current constraints on running of the spectral index by up to a factor of four, improving constraints on curvature by a factor of ten, and providing non-Gaussianity constraints that are competitive with the current CMB bounds.},

	Abstract = {The quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatly accelerated in recent years. Further leaps forward will be facilitated by imminent projects, which will enable us to map the evolution of dark and baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these fluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Dark energy and gravity both affect how rapidly structure grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth of structure, while the greater the gravity, the more enhanced the growth. While distance measurements also constrain dark energy, the comparison of growth and distance data tests whether General Relativity describes the laws of physics accurately on large scales. Modified gravity models are able to reproduce the distance measurements but at the cost of altering the growth of structure (these signatures are described in more detail in the accompanying paper on Novel Probes of Gravity and Dark Energy). Upcoming surveys will exploit these differences to determine whether the acceleration of the Universe is due to dark energy or to modified gravity. To realize this potential, both wide field imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects including DES, eBOSS, DESI, PFS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST are in line to map more than a 1000 cubic-billion-light-year volume of the Universe. These will map the cosmic structure growth rate to 1% in the redshift range 0<z<2, over the last 3/4 of the age of the Universe.},

@article{jain:2013,
	Abstract = {The discovery of cosmic acceleration has stimulated theorists to consider dark energy or modifications to Einstein's General Relativity as possible explanations. The last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyond smooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. While the theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence of fifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observational signatures. This report focuses on observations that differ from the conventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure. Examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via lab experiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearby universe, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters, and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. The observational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratory experiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radio observations. In the coming decade, searches for these effects have the potential for discovering fundamental new physics. We discuss how the searches can be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modest adaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. The accompanying paper on the Growth of Cosmic Structure describes complementary tests of gravity with observations of large-scale structure.},

	Abstract = {Neutrino masses are clear evidence for physics beyond the standard model and much more remains to be understood about the neutrino sector. We highlight some of the outstanding questions and research opportunities in neutrino theory. We show that most of these questions are directly connected to the very rich experimental program currently being pursued (or at least under serious consideration) in the United States and worldwide. Finally, we also comment on the state of the theoretical neutrino physics community in the U.S.},

@article{arrenberg:2013,
	Abstract = {In this Report we discuss the four complementary searches for the identity of dark matter: direct detection experiments that look for dark matter interacting in the lab, indirect detection experiments that connect lab signals to dark matter in our own and other galaxies, collider experiments that elucidate the particle properties of dark matter, and astrophysical probes sensitive to non-gravitational interactions of dark matter. The complementarity among the different dark matter searches is discussed qualitatively and illustrated quantitatively in several theoretical scenarios. Our primary conclusion is that the diversity of possible dark matter candidates requires a balanced program based on all four of those approaches.},

	Abstract = {As part of the Snowmass process, the Cosmic Frontier Indirect-Detection subgroup (CF2) has drawn on input from the Cosmic Frontier and the broader Particle Physics community to produce this document. The purposes of this report are to identify opportunities for dark matter science through indirect detection, to give an overview of the primary scientific drivers for indirect searches for dark matter, and to survey current and planned experiments that have, as a large part of their scientific program, the goal of searching for indirect (or astrophysical) signatures of dark matter. We primarily address existing experiments with a large U.S. role, or future experiments where a U.S. contribution is sought. We also address the limitations of this technique, and answer the tough questions relevant to this subgroup posed by the HEP community through the Snowmass process.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of cosmic acceleration has inspired ambitious experimental and observational efforts to understand its origin. Many of these take the form of large astronomical surveys, sometimes using new, special-purpose instrumentation, and in some cases entirely new facilities. This Report summarizes some of the major ongoing and planned dark energy experiments, focusing on those in which the U.S. community has a leading or significant supporting role. It provides background information for other Reports from the "Dark Energy and CMB" working group of the APS Division of Particles and Fields long-term planning exercise. We provide 1-2 page summaries of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and its SDSS-IV successor eBOSS, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Camera (HSC) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS), the Hobby-Eberley Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HEDTEX), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Large Synpotic Survey Telescope (LSST), and the Euclid and AFTA-WFIRST (Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope) space missions. Over the next one to two decades, these experiments seek to improve the precision of measurements of the cosmic expansion history and cosmic structure growth by factors of 10-100, while simultaneously increasing their redshift range and tightening control and cross-checks of sytematic effects. These measurements will dramatically improve the empirical constraints on theoretical explanations of cosmic acceleration and could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the nature of gravity and spacetime or the forms of energy present in the universe.},

@article{rhodes:2013,
	Abstract = {In this report, we present a wide variety of ways in which information from multiple probes of dark energy may be combined to obtain additional information not accessible when they are considered separately. Fundamentally, because all major probes are affected by the underlying distribution of matter in the regions studied, there exist covariances between them that can provide information on cosmology. Combining multiple probes allows for more accurate (less contaminated by systematics) and more precise (since there is cosmological information encoded in cross-correlation statistics) measurements of dark energy. The potential of cross-correlation methods is only beginning to be realized. By bringing in information from other wavelengths, the capabilities of the existing probes of dark energy can be enhanced and systematic effects can be mitigated further. We present a mixture of work in progress and suggestions for future scientific efforts. Given the scope of future dark energy experiments, the greatest gains may only be realized with more coordination and cooperation between multiple project teams; we recommend that this interchange should begin sooner, rather than later, to maximize scientific gains.},

	Abstract = {In these Lectures, I review various extensions of the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model, characterized by additional light degrees of freedom in the dark sector. In order to reproduce the successful phenomenology of GR in the solar system, these fields must effectively decouple from matter on solar system/laboratory scales. This is achieved through screening mechanisms, which rely on the interplay between self-interactions and coupling to matter to suppress deviations from standard gravity. The manifestation of the new degrees of freedom depends sensitively on their environment, which in turn leads to striking experimental signatures.},

	Abstract = {In the present paper we study the radio sources in the NRAO VLA SKY Survey (NVSS) analysing its power spectrum and galaxy distribution. There is a discrepancy between the theoretical models in the literature and the data at large scales. A new model for NVSS is proposed combining the power spectrum data from NVSS and the galaxy distribution from the Combined EIS-NVSS Survey Of Radio Sources (CENSORS). Taken into account these two data sets the differences in the power spectrum at large scales are reduced, but there is still some tension between the two data sets. Different models are compared using Bayesian evidence. A model for the galaxy distribution based on a gamma function provides a higher evidence against other models proposed in the literature. In addition, the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity has been also considered. The 2-sigma constraints on the local non-Gaussian f_NL parameter are -43 < f_NL < 142.},

@article{rasera:2013,
	Abstract = {We investigate the non-linear evolution of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the low-redshift matter Power Spectrum (PS) from the DEUS-FUR $\Lambda$CDM model simulation. This is the first cosmological N-body simulation encompassing the full observable cosmic volume, thus enabling the possibility to derive cosmic variance limited predictions of the matter PS at BAO scales. We control the effect of numerical systematic errors using a series of large volume high-resolution simulations. The combined analysis allows us to measure the matter PS between z=0 and 1 to 1% over the entire BAO range, $0.03<k [\textrm{h Mpc}^{-1}]<0.3$, in bins of size $\Delta k/k < 1\%$. We define the BAO with respect to a non-linearly evolved smooth (wiggle-free) spectrum and determine the characteristics of the BAO peaks and dips without recurring to extrapolation from global fitting functions. We quantify the effects of non-linearities on the position and amplitude of the BAO extrema, and the coupling to the broadband slope of the PS. We compare these estimates against non-linear predictions from semi-analytical models. As an example, we show that the halo model prescription (Halofit) overestimates the amplitude of the BAO, while the regularized multi-point propagator method (RegPT), though very accurate up to $k=0.15$ h Mpc$^{-1}$, fails to account for the broadband slope at smaller scales. Quite remarkably from the analysis of the redshift evolution of BAO we find that the second dip and third peak remains unaltered by non-linear effects. Furthermore, we find that the square of the damping factor and the shift of the position of BAO extrema scale to good approximation as the square of the growth factor, in agreement with expectations from perturbation theory. This confirms the idea that an accurate measurement of BAO at different redshifts can directly probe the growth of cosmic structures.},

	Abstract = {We study the ability of future cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiments and redshift surveys to constrain a 13-dimensional parameterization of the adiabatic cold dark matter model. Each alone is unable to determine all parameters to high accuracy. However, considered together, one data set resolves the difficulties of the other, allowing certain degenerate parameters to be determined with far greater precision. We treat in detail the degeneracies involving the classical cosmological parameters, massive neutrinos, tensor-scalar ratio, bias, and reionization optical depth as well as how redshift surveys can resolve them. We discuss the opportunities for internal and external consistency checks on these measurements. Previous papers on parameter estimation have generally treated smaller parameter spaces; in direct comparisons to these works, we tend to find weaker constraints and suggest numerical explanations for the discrepancies.},

	Abstract = {We explore the reconstruction of the gravitational lensing field of the cosmic microwave background in real space. We show that very little statistical information is lost when estimators of short range on the celestial sphere are used in place of the customary estimators in harmonic space, which are nonlocal and in principle require a simultaneous analysis of the entire sky without any cuts or excisions. Because virtually all the information relevant to lensing reconstruction lies on angular scales close to the resolution scale of the sky map, the gravitational lensing convergence and shear fields (which unlike the deflection field or lensing potential are directly related to the observations in a local manner) may be reconstructed by means of quadratic combinations involving only closely separated pixels. Even though harmonic space provides a more natural context for understanding lensing reconstruction theoretically, the real space methods developed here have the virtue of being faster to implement and are likely to prove useful for analyzing realistic maps containing a galactic cut and possibly numerous small excisions to exclude point sources that cannot be reliably subtracted.},

	Abstract = {We review the statistical properties of the main populations of radio sources, as emerging from radio and millimeter sky surveys. Recent determinations of local luminosity functions are presented and compared with earlier estimates still in widespread use. A number of unresolved issues are discussed. These include: the (possibly luminosity-dependent) decline of source space densities at high redshifts; the possible dichotomies between evolutionary properties of low- versus high-luminosity and of flat- versus steep-spectrum AGN-powered radio sources; and the nature of sources accounting for the upturn of source counts at sub-milli-Jansky (mJy) levels. It is shown that straightforward extrapolations of evolutionary models, accounting for both the far-IR counts and redshift distributions of star-forming galaxies, match the radio source counts at flux-density levels of tens of muJy remarkably well. We consider the statistical properties of rare but physically very interesting classes of sources, such as GHz Peak Spectrum and ADAF/ADIOS sources, and radio afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. We also discuss the exploitation of large-area radio surveys to investigate large-scale structure through studies of clustering and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Finally, we briefly describe the potential of the new and forthcoming generations of radio telescopes. A compendium of source counts at different frequencies is given in Supplementary Material.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we measure the angular power spectra Cl of three high-redshift large-scale structure probes: the radio sources from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the quasar catalogue of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release Six (SDSS DR6 QSOs) and the MegaZ-LRG (DR7), the final SDSS II Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) photometric redshift survey. We perform a global analysis of the constraints on the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity from these angular power spectra, as well as from their cross-correlation power spectra with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature map. In particular, we include non-Gaussianity of the type arising from single-field slow roll, multifields, curvaton (local type), and those which effects on the halo clustering can be described by the equilateral template (related to higher-order derivative type non-Gaussianity) and by the enfolded template (related to modified initial state or higher-derivative interactions). When combining all data sets, we obtain limits of fNL = 48$\pm$20, fNL = 50$\pm$265 and fNL = 183$\pm$95 at 68% confidence level for local, equilateral and enfolded templates, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the constraint on the cubic correction gNLphi3 on the bias of dark matter haloes and obtain a limit of -1.2 × 105 < gNL < 11.3 × 105 at 95% confidence level.},

	Abstract = {We measure the angular power spectrum Cl of radio galaxies in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) using two independent methods: direct spherical harmonic analysis and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The results are consistent and can be understood using models for the spatial matter power spectrum and for the redshift distribution of radio galaxies at mJy flux density levels. A good fit to the angular power spectrum can only be achieved if radio galaxies possess high bias with respect to mass fluctuations; by marginalizing over the other parameters of the model we derive a 68 per cent confidence interval 1.53 < b0 × sigma8 < 1.87, where b0 is the linear bias factor for radio galaxies and sigma8 describes the normalization of the matter power spectrum. Our models indicate that the majority of the signal in the NVSS Cl spectrum is generated at low redshifts z <~ 0.1. Individual redshifts for the NVSS sources are thus required to alleviate projection effects and probe directly the matter power spectrum on large scales.},

@article{hernandez-monteagudo:2010,
	Abstract = {In the context of the study of the integrated Sachs Wolfe effect (ISW), we revisit the angular cross correlation of WMAP cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with the NRAO Very Large Array Sky Survey (NVSS). We compute 2-point cross functions between the two surveys, both in real and in Fourier space, paying particular attention on the dependence of results on the flux of NVSS radio sources, the angular scales where correlations arise and the comparison with theoretical expectations. We reproduce previous results that claim an excess of correlation in the angular correlation function (ACF), and we also find some (low significance, ~2-sigma) similarity between the CMB and radio galaxy data in the multipole range l ∈ [10, 25]. However, the signal to noise ratio (S/N) in the ACFs increases with higher flux thresholds for NVSS sources, but drops a ~ 30-50% in separations of the order of a pixel size, suggesting some residual point source contribution. When restricting our analyses to multipoles l < 60, we fail to find any evidence for cross correlation in the range l ∈ [2,10], where according to the model predictions and our simulations ~ 50% of the S/N is supposed to arise. Also, the accumulated S/N for l<60 is below 1, far from the theoretical expectation of S/N ~ 5. Part of this disagreement may be caused by an inaccurate modeling of the NVSS source population: as in previous works, we find a level of large scale (l < 70) clustering in the NVSS catalog that seems incompatible with a high redshift population. This large scale clustering excess is unlikely to be caused by contaminants or systematics, since it is independent of flux threshold, and hence present for the brightest, most clearly detected (> 30sigma) NVSS sources. Either our NVSS catalogs are not probing the high redshift, large scale gravitational potential wells, or there is a clear mismatch between the ISW component present in WMAP data and theoretical expectations.},

	Abstract = {We use a quadratic maximum likelihood (QML) method to estimate the angular power spectrum of the cross-correlation between cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure maps as well as their individual auto-spectra. We describe our implementation of this method and demonstrate its accuracy on simulated maps. We apply this optimal estimator to Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 7-yr and National Radio Astronomical Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array Sky Survey (NVSS) data and explore the robustness of the angular power spectrum estimates obtained by the QML method. With the correction of the declination systematics in NVSS, we can safely use most of the information contained in this survey. We then make use of the angular power spectrum estimates obtained by the QML method to derive constraints on the dark energy critical density in a flat Lambda cold dark matter model by different likelihood prescriptions. When using just the cross-correlation between WMAP 7-yr and NVSS maps with 1$\,^{\circ}$.8 resolution, the best-fitting model has a cosmological constant of approximately 70 per cent of the total energy density, disfavouring an Einstein-de sitter universe at more than 2sigma confidence level.},

	Abstract = {We compare cosmic microwave background lensing convergence maps derived from South Pole Telescope (SPT) data with galaxy survey data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey, WISE, and a new large Spitzer/IRAC field designed to overlap with the SPT survey. Using optical and infrared catalogs covering between 17 and 68 deg2 of sky, we detect a correlation between the SPT convergence maps and each of the galaxy density maps at >4sigma, with zero correlation robustly ruled out in all cases. The amplitude and shape of the cross-power spectra are in good agreement with theoretical expectations and the measured galaxy bias is consistent with previous work. The detections reported here utilize a small fraction of the full 2500 deg2 SPT survey data and serve as both a proof of principle of the technique and an illustration of the potential of this emerging cosmological probe.},

We use the full covariance matrix to filter the data, and calculate the cross-power spectra for the lensing-galaxy correlation. We explore the impact of changing the values of cosmological parameters on the lensing reconstruction, and obtain statistical detection significances at >3sigma. The results of all cross correlations pass the curl null test as well as a complementary diagnostic test using the NVSS data in equatorial coordinates. We forecast the potential for Planck and NVSS to constrain the lensing-galaxy cross correlation as well as the galaxy bias.

We focus on the role large scale polarization can play. Polarization probes the integrated optical depth across the entire epoch of reionization. Future missions such as Planck and CMBPol will greatly enhance our knowledge of the reionization history, allowing us to measure the time evolution of the ionization fraction. As large scale polarization probes high redshift activity, it can best constrain models where the Universe was fully or partially ionized at early times. In fact, large scale polarization could be our only probe of the highest redshifts.},

@inproceedings{smith:2009,
	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background by large-scale structure in the late universe is both a source of cosmological information and a potential contaminant of primordial gravity waves. Because lensing imprints growth of structure in the late universe on the CMB, measurements of CMB lensing will constrain parameters to which the CMB would not otherwise be sensitive, such as neutrino mass.  In CMB polarization, gravitational lensing is the largest guaranteed source of B-mode (or curl-like) polarization. Future CMB polarization experiments with sufficient sensitivity to measure B-modes on small angular scales (~1000) can measure lensing with better sensitivity, and on different scales, than could be achieved by measuring CMB temperature alone. If the instrumental noise is sufficiently small (<~5 muK-arcmin), the gravitational lensing contribution to the large-scale B-mode will be the limiting source of contamination when constraining a stochastic background of gravity waves in the early universe, one of the most exciting prospects for future CMB polarization experiments. High-sensitivity measurements of small-scale B-modes can reduce this contamination through a lens reconstruction technique that separates the lensing and primordial contributions to the B-mode on large scales.  A fundamental design decision for a future CMB polarization experiment such as CMBpol is whether to have coarse angular resolution so that only the large-scale B-mode (and the large-scale E-mode from reionization) is measured, or high resolution to additionally measure CMB lensing. The purpose of this white paper is to evaluate the science case for CMB lensing in polarization: constraints on cosmological parameters, increased sensitivity to the gravity wave B-mode via lens reconstruction, expected level of contamination from non-CMB foregrounds, and required control of beam systematics.},

	Abstract = {The decay rate of cosmological gravitational potential measures the deviation from Einstein-de Sitter universe and can put strong constraints on the nature of dark energy and gravity. The usual method to measure this decay rate is through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect-large-scale structure (LSS) cross-correlation. However, the interpretation of the measured correlation signal is complicated by galaxy bias and the matter power spectrum. This could bias and/or degrade its constraints on the nature of dark energy and gravity. But combining the lensing-LSS cross-correlation measurements, the decay rate of gravitational potential can be isolated. For any given narrow redshift bin of LSS, the ratio of the two cross-correlations directly measures (dlnDphi/dlna)H(z)/W(chi, chis), where Dphi is the linear growth factor of the gravitational potential, H is the Hubble constant at redshift z, W(chi, chis) is the lensing kernel, and chi and chis are the comoving angular diameter distance to lens and source, respectively. This method is optimal in the sense that (1) the measured quantity is essentially free of systematic errors and is only limited by cosmic variance, and (2) the measured quantity depends only on several cosmological parameters and can be predicted from first principles unambiguously. Although fundamentally limited by the inevitably large cosmic variance associated with the ISW measurements, it can still put useful independent constraints on the amount of dark energy and its equation of state. It can also provide a powerful test of modified gravity and can distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model from LambdaCDM at >2.5 sigma confidence level.},

	Abstract = {We implement a matched filter (MF) cross-correlation algorithm in multipole space and compare it to the standard angular cross power spectrum (ACPS) method. Then we apply both methods to a integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) - large scale structure (LSS) cross correlation scenario. We study how sky masks influence the multipole range where the cross correlation signal arises and compare it to theoretical predictions. The MF requires the inversion of a multipole covariance matrix that, under partial sky coverage (f_sky<1), is generally non diagonal and singular. We chose a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach that enables identification of those modes carrying most of the information from those more likely to introduce numerical noise (that are dropped from the analysis). We compared the MF to the ACPS in ISW-LSS Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on the effect that a limited sky coverage has on the cross-correlation results. Within the data model {{s}}= {{t}}+ alpha {{m}} where {{t}} is Gaussian noise and {{m}} is a known filter, we find that the MF performs better than the ACPS for lower values of f_sky and scale-dependent (non-Poissonian) noise fields. In the context of ISW studies, both methods are comparable, although the MF performs slightly more sensitively under more restrictive masks (lower values of f_sky). A preliminary analytical study of the ISW-LSS cross correlation signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio shows that most of it should be found on very large scales (50% of the S/N at l<10, 90% at l<40-50), and this is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. The statistical significance of our cross-correlation statistics reaches its maximum when considering lin [2,lmax], with lmax in[5,40] for all values of f_sky observed, despite the smoothing and power aliasing that aggressive masks introduce in Fourier space. This l-confinement of the ISW-LSS cross correlation should enable a safe distinction from other secondary effects arising on smaller (higher l-s) angular scales.},

	Abstract = {Constraining cosmological parameters from measurements of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect requires developing robust and accurate methods for computing statistical errors in the cross-correlation between maps. This paper presents a detailed comparison of such error estimation applied to the case of cross-correlation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We compare theoretical models for error estimation with Monte Carlo simulations where both the galaxy and the CMB maps vary around a fiducial autocorrelation and cross-correlation model which agrees well with the current concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. Our analysis compares estimators both in harmonic and configuration (or real) space, quantifies the accuracy of the error analysis and discusses the impact of partial sky survey area and the choice of input fiducial model on dark energy constraints. We show that purely analytic approaches yield accurate errors even in surveys that cover only 10 per cent of the sky and that parameter constraints strongly depend on the fiducial model employed. Alternatively, we discuss the advantages and limitations of error estimators that can be directly applied to data. In particular, we show that errors and covariances from the jackknife method agree well with the theoretical approaches and simulations. We also introduce a novel method in real space that is computationally efficient and can be applied to real data and realistic survey geometries. Finally, we present a number of new findings and prescriptions that can be useful for analysis of real data and forecasts, and present a critical summary of the analyses done to date.},

	Abstract = {The cross-correlation between cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies and the large-scale structure (LSS) traced by the galaxy distribution, or sources at different wavelengths, is now well known. This correlation results from the integrated Sachs--Wolfe (ISW) effect in CMB anisotropies generated at late times due to the dark energy component of the Universe. In a reionized universe, electron scattering at low redshifts leads to a large-scale polarization contribution. In addition to the primordial quadrupole, involving anisotropies at the last scattering surface, the ISW quadrupole rescatters and contributes to the large angular scale polarization signal. Thus, in principle, the low multipole polarization bump in the E-mode should be correlated with the galaxy distribution. Unlike the CMB temperature--LSS correlation that peaks for tracers at low redshifts, due to the increasing visibility function, while the fractional ISW quadrupole is decreasing, with increasing redshift, the polarization--galaxy correlation peaks mostly at redshifts between 1 and 3. Under certain conditions, mostly involving a low optical depth to reionization if the Universe reionized at a redshift around 6, the cross-polarization--source signal is marginally detectable if all-sky maps of the large-scale structure at redshifts between 1 and 3 are available. If the Universe reionized at a redshift higher than 10, it is unlikely that this correlation will be detectable even with no instrumental noise all-sky maps. While our estimates do not guarantee a detection, unknown physics related to the dark energy uncertain issues related to the large angular scale CMB and polarization anisotropies, and uncertainties related to the reionization history of the Universe may motivate attempts to measure this correlation using upcoming CMB polarization E-mode maps and large-scale structure maps of the high-redshift universe with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and quasar catalogues, among others.},

	Abstract = {The scattering of the temperature anisotropy quadrupole by free electrons in galaxy clusters leads to a now well-known polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. Using multifrequency polarization data, one can extract the temperature quadrupole and separate it from the contaminant polarization associated with the kinematic quadrupole due to the transverse motion of clusters. At low redshifts, the temperature quadrupole contains a significant contribution from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) associated with the growth of density fluctuations. Using polarization data from a sample of clusters over a wide range in redshift, one can statistically establish the presence of the ISW effect and determine the redshift dependence of the ISW contribution to the rms quadrupole. Given the strong dependence of the ISW effect on the background cosmology, the cluster polarization can eventually be used as a probe of the dark energy.},

	Abstract = {A crucial diagnostic of the LambdaCDM cosmological model is the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect of large-scale structure on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The ISW imprint of superstructures of size ~ 100 h-1Mpc at redshift z ~ 0.5 has been detected with > 4sigma significance, however it has been noted that the signal is much larger than expected. We revisit the calculation using linear theory predictions in LambdaCDM cosmology for the number density of superstructures and their radial density profile, and take possible selection effects into account. While our expected signal is larger than previous estimates, it is still inconsistent by > 3sigma with the observation. If the observed signal is indeed due to the ISW effect then huge, extremely underdense voids are far more common in the observed universe than predicted by LambdaCDM.},

	Abstract = {The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is a direct signature of the
	presence of dark energy in the universe, in the absence of spatial
	curvature. A powerful method for observing the ISW effect is through
	cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave background with a tracer
	of the matter in the low redshift universe. In this paper, we describe
	the dependence of the obtained cross-correlation signal on the geometry
	and other properties of a survey of the low redshift universe. We
	show that an all-sky survey with about 10×106 galaxies, almost uniformly
	distributed within 0<z<1 should yield a near optimal ISW detection,
	at ˜5sigma level. In order to achieve this level of signal-to-noise,
	the systematic anisotropies in the survey must be below ˜0.1%, on
	the scale of ˜10$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky, while the systematic error
	in redshift estimates must be less than 0.05. Then, we argue that,
	while an ISW detection will not be a good way of constraining the
	conventional properties of dark energy, it could be a valuable means
	of testing alternative theories of gravity on large physical scales.},

	Abstract = {We report on work to increase the number of well-measured Type Ia
	supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshifts. Light curves, including high
	signal-to-noise Hubble Space Telescope data, and spectra of six SNe
	Ia that were discovered during 2001, are presented. Additionally,
	for the two SNe with z > 1, we present ground-based J-band photometry
	from Gemini and the Very Large Telescope. These are among the most
	distant SNe Ia for which ground-based near-IR observations have been
	obtained. We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that
	have recently become available in the literature to the Union compilation.
	We have made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain,
	the most important ones being the refitting of all light curves with
	the SALT2 fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We
	call this new compilation, consisting of 557 SNe, the Union2 compilation.
	The flat concordance LambdaCDM model remains an excellent fit to
	the Union2 data with the best-fit constant equation-of-state parameter
	w = -0.997+0.050 -0.054(stat)+0.077 -0.082(stat + sys together) for
	a flat universe, or w = -1.038+0.056 -0.059(stat)+0.093 -0.097(stat
	+ sys together) with curvature. We also present improved constraints
	on w(z). While no significant change in w with redshift is detected,
	there is still considerable room for evolution in w. The strength
	of the constraints depends strongly on redshift. In particular, at
	z >~ 1, the existence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained
	by the data. Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA
	Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space
	Telescope Science Institute (STScI). STScI is operated by the Association
	of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc. under the
	NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The observations are associated with programs
	HST-GO-08585 and HST-GO-09075. Based, in part, on observations obtained
	at the ESO La Silla Paranal Observatory (ESO programs 67.A-0361 and

	Abstract = {One of the nicest results in cosmological perturbation theory is the
	analytical resummaton of the leading corrections at large momentum,
	which was obtained by Crocce and Scoccimarro for the propagator in
	Crocce (2005). Using an exact evolution equation, we generalize this
	result, by showing that a class of next-to-leading corrections can
	also be resummed at all orders in perturbation theory. The new corrections
	modify the propagator by a few percent in the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation
	range of scales, and therefore cannot be neglected in resummation
	schemes aiming at an accuracy compatible with future generation galaxy
	surveys. Similar tools can be employed to derive improved approximations
	for the Power Spectrum.},

	Abstract = {A new computational scheme for the nonlinear cosmological matter power
	spectrum (PS) is presented. It allows an analytic summation, at all
	orders in perturbation theory, of the leading contributions at small
	scales, thus extending to the PS the program initiated by Crocce
	and Scoccimarro for the nonlinear propagator. Our method is based
	on evolution equations in time, which can be cast in a form extremely
	convenient for fast numerical evaluations. A nonlinear PS is obtained
	in a time comparable to that needed for a simple 1-loop computation,
	and the numerical implementation is very simple. Our results agree
	with N-body simulations at the percent level in the BAO range of
	scales, and at the few-percent level up to $k ~ 1$ h/Mpc at $z >=
	0.5$, thereby opening the possibility of applying this tool to scales
	interesting for weak lensing. We clarify the relation between our
	approach and previous ones, such as the Time Renormalization Group,
	and the multi-point propagator expansion. We discuss possible lines
	of improvements of the method and its intrinsic limitations by multi
	streaming at small scales and low redshifts.},

	To this end, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to perform
	comparisons to the supernova Ia union 2 compilation, combined with
	the Hubble Space Telescope measurements of the Hubble constant, and
	the Hubble parameter datasets. The cosmographic approach to our analysis
	is revisited and extended for new notions of redshift presented as
	alternatives to the redshift z. Furthermore, we introduce a new set
	of fitting parameters describing the kinematical evolution of the
	Universe in terms of the equation of state of the Universe and derivatives
	of the total pressure. Our results are consistent with the \Lambda

	Abstract = {We show that the evolution of the number density of rich clusters
	of galaxies breaks the degeneracy between Omega (the mass density
	ratio of the universe) and sigma 8 (the normalization of the power
	spectrum), sigma 8 Omega 0.5 ~= 0.5, that follows from the observed
	present-day abundance of rich clusters. The evolution of high-mass
	(Coma-like) clusters is strong in Omega = 1, low- sigma 8 models
	(such as the standard biased cold dark matter model with sigma 8
	~= 0.5), where the number density of clusters decreases by a factor
	of about 103 from z = 0 to z ~= 0.5; the same clusters show only
	mild evolution in low- Omega , high- sigma 8 models, where the decrease
	is a factor of about 10. This diagnostic provides a most powerful
	constraint on Omega . Using observations of clusters to z ~= 0.5--1,
	we find only mild evolution in the observed cluster abundance. We
	find Omega = 0.3 +/- 0.1 and sigma 8 = 0.85 +/- 0.15 (for Lamda =

	Abstract = {We present a map of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
	induced by the late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. The map is constructed
	by combining the information of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
	Probe 7-yr CMB data and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) through a
	linear filter. This combination improves the quality of the map that
	would be obtained using information only from the large-scale structure
	data. In order to apply the filter, a given cosmological model needs
	to be assumed. In particular, we consider the standard Lambda cold
	dark matter model. As a test of consistency, we show that the reconstructed
	map is in agreement with the assumed model, which is also favoured
	against a scenario where no correlation between the CMB and NVSS
	catalogue is considered.},

	Abstract = {We apply the time-renormalization group approach to study the effect
	of primordial non-Gaussianities in the non-linear evolution of cosmological
	dark matter density perturbations. This method improves the standard
	perturbation approach by solving renormalization group-like equations
	governing the dynamics of gravitational instability. The primordial
	bispectra constructed from the dark matter density contrast and the
	velocity fields represent initial conditions for the renormalization
	group flow. We consider local, equilateral and folded shapes for
	the initial non-Gaussianity and analyze as well the case in which
	the non-linear parameter fNL parametrizing the strength of the non-Gaussianity
	depends on the momenta in Fourier space through a power-law relation,
	the so-called running non-Gaussianity. For the local model of non-Gaussianity
	we compare our findings for the power-spectrum with those of recent
	N-body simulations and find that they accurately fit the N-body data
	up to wave-numbers k ~ 0.25 h/Mpc at z = 0. We also present predictions
	for the (reduced) matter bispectra for the various shapes of non-Gaussianity.},

	A proposed new instrument, the Wide-Field Multi-Object Spectrograph

	WFMOS would also revolutionize studies of the kinematics of the Milky

	Abstract = {Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) encodes
	cosmological information in the observed anisotropies of temperature
	and polarization. Accurate extraction of this additional information
	requires precise modeling of the covariance matrix of the power spectra
	of observed CMB fields. We introduce a new analytical model to describe
	the non-Gaussian structure of this covariance matrix and display
	the importance of second-order terms that were previously neglected.
	When compared with direct numerical simulations our model captures
	parameter errors to better than a few percent for cases where the
	non-Gaussianity causes an order unity degradation in errors. We also
	provide a detailed comparison between the information content of
	lensed CMB power spectra and ideal reconstruction of the lensing
	potential. We illustrate the impact of the non-Gaussian terms in
	the power spectrum covariance by providing Fisher errors on the sum
	of the masses of the neutrinos, the dark energy equation of state,
	and the curvature of the Universe.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the concept of multipoint propagators between linear
	cosmic fields and their nonlinear counterparts in the context of
	cosmological perturbation theory. Such functions express how a nonlinearly
	evolved Fourier mode depends on the full ensemble of modes in the
	initial density field. We identify and resum the dominant diagrams
	in the large-k limit, showing explicitly that multipoint propagators
	decay into the nonlinear regime at the same rate as the two-point
	propagator. These analytic results generalize the large-k limit behavior
	of the two-point propagator to arbitrary order. We measure the three-point
	propagator as a function of triangle shape in numerical simulations
	and confirm the results of our high-k resummation. We show that any
	n-point spectrum can be reconstructed from multipoint propagators,
	which leads to a physical connection between nonlinear corrections
	to the power spectrum at small scales and higher-order correlations
	at large scales. As a first application of these results, we calculate
	the reduced bispectrum at one loop in renormalized perturbation theory
	and show that we can predict the decrease in its dependence on triangle
	shape at redshift zero, when standard perturbation theory is least
	successful.},

	Abstract = {We perform an extensive suite of N-body simulations of the matter
	power spectrum, incorporating massive neutrinos in the range Mnu=
	0.15-0.6 eV, probing the non-linear regime at scales k < 10 h Mpc-1
	at z < 3. We extend the widely used HALOFIT approximation to account
	for the effect of massive neutrinos on the power spectrum. In the
	strongly non-linear regime, HALOFIT systematically overpredicts the
	suppression due to the free streaming of the neutrinos. The maximal
	discrepancy occurs at k{\`A}{\'u} 1h Mpc-1, and is at the level of
	10 per cent of the total suppression. Most published constraints
	on neutrino masses based on HALOFIT are not affected, as they rely
	on data probing the matter power spectrum in the linear or mildly
	non-linear regime. However, predictions for future galaxy, Lyman
	alpha forest and weak lensing surveys extending to more non-linear
	scales will benefit from the improved approximation to the non-linear
	matter power spectrum we provide. Our approximation reproduces the
	induced neutrino suppression over the targeted scales and redshifts
	significantly better. We test its robustness with regard to changing
	cosmological parameters and a variety of modelling effects.},

	Abstract = {We measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the
	galaxy clustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date,
	z= 0.6, using the distribution of N= 132 509 emission-line galaxies
	in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We quantify BAOs using three statistics:
	the galaxy correlation function, power spectrum and the band-filtered
	estimator introduced by Xu et al. The results are mutually consistent,
	corresponding to a 4.0 per cent measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift
	relation at z= 0.6 [in terms of the acoustic parameter 'A(z)' introduced
	by Eisenstein et al., we find A(z= 0.6) = 0.452 $\pm$ 0.018]. Both
	BAOs and power spectrum shape information contribute towards these
	constraints. The statistical significance of the detection of the
	acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to a wiggle-free
	model, is 3.2sigma. The ratios of our distance measurements to those
	obtained using BAOs in the distribution of luminous red galaxies
	at redshifts z= 0.2 and 0.35 are consistent with a flat Lambda cold
	dark matter model that also provides a good fit to the pattern of
	observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
	The addition of the current WiggleZ data results in a ‚{\^a}{\`a}30
	per cent improvement in the measurement accuracy of a constant equation
	of state, w, using BAO data alone. Based solely on geometric BAO
	distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w < -1/3) is required with
	a probability of 99.8 per cent, providing a consistency check of
	conclusions based on supernovae observations. Further improvements
	in cosmological constraints will result when the WiggleZ survey data
	set is complete.},

	Galaxy Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, producing a stacked survey
	correlation function in which the statistical significance of the

	model with no peak. We fit cosmological models to this combined baryon
	acoustic oscillation (BAO) data set comprising six distance-redshift
	data points, and compare the results with similar cosmological fits
	to the latest compilation of supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave
	background (CMB) data. The BAO and SNe data sets produce consistent
	measurements of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, when separately

	errors in either of these distance probes. Combining all data sets
	we determine w=-1.03 $\pm$ 0.08 for a flat universe, consistent with

	for testing models in which cosmic structure arose from inflation-generated
	Gaussian density perturbations. Using a Bayesian analysis to constrain
	the amplitude of the perturbation spectrum, it is shown that adiabatic
	hot-dark-matter models are convincingly ruled out and cold-dark-matter
	models have anisotropies near the derived limits. Theories with broken
	scale invariance such as isocurvature baryon models are strongly
	constrained, as are models with extra power crafted to give significant
	large-scale structures and flows.},

	Abstract = {Observations of distant supernovae and the fluctuations in the cosmic
	microwave background (CMB) indicate that the expansion of the Universe
	may be accelerating under the action of a `cosmological constant'
	or some other form of `dark energy'. This dark energy now appears
	to dominate the Universe and not only alters its expansion rate,
	but also affects the evolution of fluctuations in the density of
	matter, slowing down the gravitational collapse of material (into,
	for example, clusters of galaxies) in recent times. Additional fluctuations
	in the temperature of CMB photons are induced as they pass through
	large-scale structures and these fluctuations are necessarily correlated
	with the distribution of relatively nearby matter. Here we report
	the detection of correlations between recent CMB data and two probes
	of large-scale structure: the X-ray background and the distribution
	of radio galaxies. These correlations are consistent with those predicted
	by dark energy, indicating that we are seeing the imprint of dark

	Abstract = {The notion of adhesion has been advanced for the phenomenon of stabilization
	of large-scale structure emerging from gravitational instability
	of a cold medium. Recently, the physical origin of adhesion has been
	identified: a systematic derivation of the equations of motion for
	the density and the velocity fields leads naturally to the key equation
	of the ``adhesion approximation'' - however, under a set of strongly
	simplifying assumptions. In this work, we provide an evaluation of
	the current status of adhesive gravitational clustering and a clear
	explanation of the assumptions involved. Furthermore, we propose
	systematic generalizations with the aim to relax some of the simplifying
	assumptions. We start from the general Newtonian evolution equations
	for self-gravitating particles on an expanding Friedmann background
	and recover the popular ``dust model'' (pressureless fluid), which
	breaks down after the formation of density singularities; then we
	investigate, in a unified framework, two other models which, under
	the restrictions referred to above, lead to the ``adhesion approximation''.
	We apply the Eulerian and Lagrangian perturbative expansions to these
	new models and, finally, we discuss some non-perturbative results
	that may serve as starting points for workable approximations of
	non-linear structure formation in the multi-stream regime. In particular,
	we propose a new approximation that includes, in limiting cases,
	the standard ``adhesion model'' and the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian
	first-order approximations.},

	Abstract = {We present a new method for constructing maps of the secondary temperature
	fluctuations imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
	by photons propagating through the evolving cosmic gravitational
	potential. Large cosmological N-body simulations are used to calculate
	the complete non-linear evolution of the peculiar gravitational potential.
	Tracing light rays back through the past light cone of a chosen observer
	accurately captures the temperature perturbations generated by linear
	(the integrated Sachs-Wolfe or ISW effect) and non-linear (the Rees-Sciama
	or RS effect) evolution. These effects give rise to three kinds of
	non-linear features in the temperature maps. (i) In overdense regions,
	converging flows of matter induce cold spots of the order of 100
	Mpc in extent which can dominate over the ISW effect at high redshift,
	and are surrounded by hot rings. (ii) In underdense regions, the
	RS effect enhances ISW cold spots which can be surrounded by weak
	hot rings. (iii) Transverse motions of large lumps of matter produce
	characteristic dipole features, consisting of adjacent hot and cold
	spots separated by a few tens of megaparsecs. These non-linear features
	are not easily detectable; they modulate the ISW sky maps at about
	the 10 per cent level. The RS effect causes the angular power spectrum
	to deviate from linear theory at l ~ 50 and generates non-Gaussianity,
	skewing the one-point distribution function to negative values. Cold
	spots of similar angular size, but much smaller amplitude than the
	CMB cold spot reported by Cruz et al. are produced. Joint analysis
	of our maps and the corresponding galaxy distribution may enable
	techniques to be developed to detect these non-linear, non-Gaussian
	features. Our maps are available at http://astro.dur.ac.uk/~cai/ISW.},

@article{carlson:2009,
	Abstract = {Recently, a number of analytic prescriptions for computing the nonlinear
	matter power spectrum have appeared in the literature. These typically
	involve resummation or closure prescriptions which do not have a
	rigorous error control, thus they must be compared with numerical
	simulations to assess their range of validity. We present a direct
	side-by-side comparison of several of these analytic approaches,
	using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations as a reference,
	and discuss some general trends. All of the analytic results correctly
	predict the behavior of the power spectrum at the onset of nonlinearity,
	and improve upon a pure linear theory description at very large scales.
	All of these theories fail at sufficiently small scales. At low redshift
	the dynamic range in scale where perturbation theory is both relevant
	and reliable can be quite small. We also compute for the first time
	the two-loop contribution to standard perturbation theory for cold
	dark matter models, finding improved agreement with simulations at
	large redshift. At low redshifts however the two-loop term is larger
	than the one-loop term on quasilinear scales, indicating a breakdown
	of the perturbation expansion. Finally, we comment on possible implications
	of our results for future studies. A software package implementing
	the methods presented here is available at http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/Copter.},

	Abstract = {Large scale structure surveys will likely become the next leading
	cosmological probe. In our universe, matter perturbations are large
	on short distances and small at long scales, i.e. strongly coupled
	in the UV and weakly coupled in the IR. To make precise analytical
	predictions on large scales, we develop an effective field theory
	formulated in terms of an IR effective fluid characterized by several
	parameters, such as speed of sound and viscosity. These parameters,
	determined by the UV physics described by the Boltzmann equation,
	are measured from N-body simulations. We find that the speed of sound
	of the effective fluid is c_s^2 ‚{\^a}{\`a} {1}{0^{{ - {6}}}}{c2}
	and that the viscosity contributions are of the same order. The fluid
	describes all the relevant physics at long scales k and permits a
	manifestly convergent perturbative expansion in the size of the matter
	perturbations delta( k) for all the observables. As an example, we
	calculate the correction to the power spectrum at order delta( k)4.
	The predictions of the effective field theory are found to be in
	much better agreement with observation than standard cosmological
	perturbation theory, already reaching percent precision at this order
	up to a relatively short scale k ‚{\~a}{\c c} 0 .24 h Mpc-1.},

	will be crucial to obtain accurate parameter constraints from sensitive

	accurate, but curvature effects change the spectra at the 0.3% 1%

	method for computing the lensing effect on CMB power spectra to better
	than 0.1% at l‚{\^a}≤2500 (within the approximation that the lensing

	Abstract = {We review the formalism and applications of the halo-based description
	of nonlinear gravitational clustering. In this approach, all mass
	is associated with virialized dark matter halos; models of the number
	and spatial distribution of the halos, and the distribution of dark
	matter within each halo, are used to provide estimates of how the
	statistical properties of large scale density and velocity fields
	evolve as a result of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We first
	describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its
	predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of nonlinear
	gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications
	of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution
	of galaxies, the nonlinear velocity, momentum and pressure fields,
	descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary
	contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave
	background. },

	Abstract = {We discuss the nonlinear extension to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect
	(ISW) resulting from the divergence of the large scale structure
	momentum density field. The nonlinear ISW effect leads to an increase
	in the total ISW contribution by roughly two orders of magnitude
	at l~1000. This increase, however, is still below the cosmic variance
	limit of the primary anisotropies; at further small angular scales,
	secondary effects such as gravitational lensing and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
	effect dominate the nonlinear ISW power spectrum. We show that this
	second-order nonlinear ISW contribution is effectively the same as
	the contribution previously described as a lensing effect due to
	the transverse motion of gravitational lenses and well known as the
	Kaiser-Stebbins effect in the context of cosmic strings. Because
	of geometrical considerations, there is no significant three-point
	correlation function, or bispectrum, between the linear ISW effect
	and its nonlinear extension. The nonlinear ISW contribution can potentially
	be used as a probe of the transverse velocity of dark matter halos
	such as galaxy clusters. Because of the small contribution to temperature
	fluctuations, of the order of a few tenths of microkelvins, however,
	extracting useful measurements on velocities will be challenging.},

	Abstract = {I discuss the correlation between the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe
	(ISW) effect in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
	anisotropies and the large scale structure of the local universe.
	This correlation has been proposed and studied in the literature
	as a probe of the dark energy and its physical properties. I consider
	a variety of large scale structure tracers suitable for a detection
	of the ISW effect via a cross correlation. In addition to luminous
	sources, I suggest the use of tracers such as dark matter halos or
	galaxy clusters. A suitable catalogue of mass selected halos for
	this purpose can be constructed with upcoming wide-field lensing
	and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys. With multifrequency data,
	the presence of the ISW-large scale structure correlation can also
	be investigated through a cross-correlation of the frequency cleaned
	SZ and CMB maps. While convergence maps constructed from lensing
	surveys of the large scale structure via galaxy ellipticities are
	less correlated with the ISW effect, lensing potentials that deflect
	CMB photons are strongly correlated and allow, probably, the best
	mechanism to study the ISW-large scale structure correlation with
	CMB data alone.},

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in
	the dark matter power spectrum and the correlation function using
	renormalized perturbation theory. In a previous paper we showed that
	renormalized perturbation theory successfully predicts the damping
	of acoustic oscillations; here we extend our calculation to the enhancement
	of power due to mode coupling. We show that mode coupling generates
	additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in the linear
	spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes defined
	with respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these
	out-of-phase oscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic
	peak of the two-point correlation function. We present predictions
	for these shifts as a function of redshift; these should be considered
	as a robust lower limit to the more realistic case that includes,
	in addition, redshift distortions and galaxy bias. We show that these
	nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to a breakdown
	of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought. We
	discuss why virialized halo profiles are not responsible for these
	effects, which can be understood from basic physics of gravitational
	instability. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical
	simulations, and can be used as a starting point for modeling baryon
	acoustic oscillations in future observations. To meet this end, we
	suggest a simple physically motivated model to correct for the shifts
	caused by mode coupling.},

	Abstract = {We have catalogued and analysed cosmological parameter determinations
	and their error bars published between the years 1990 and 2010. Our
	study focuses on the number of measurements, their precision and
	their accuracy. The accuracy of past measurements is gauged by comparison
	with the WMAP7 results. The 637 measurements in our study are of
	12 different parameters and we place the techniques used to carry
	them out into 12 different categories. We find that the number of
	published measurements per year in all 12 cases except for the dark
	energy equation of state parameter w_0 peaked between 1995 and 2004.
	Of the individual techniques, only BAO measurements were still rising
	in popularity at the end of the studied time period. The fractional
	error associated with most measurements has been declining relatively
	slowly, with several parameters, such as the amplitude of mass fluctutations
	sigma_{8} and the Hubble constant H_0 remaining close to the 10%
	precision level for a 10-15 year period. The accuracy of recent parameter
	measurements is generally what would be expected given the quoted
	error bars, although before the year 2000, the accuracy was significantly
	worse, consistent with an average underestimate of the error bars
	by a factor of ~2. When used as complement to traditional forecasting
	techniques, our results suggest that future measurements of parameters
	such as fNL, and w_a will have been informed by the gradual improvment
	in understanding and treatment of systematic errors and are likely
	to be accurate. However, care must be taken to avoid the effects
	of confirmation bias, which may be affecting recent measurements
	of dark energy parameters. For example, of the 28 measurements of
	Omega_Lambda in our sample published since 2003, only 2 are more
	than 1 sigma from the WMAP results. Wider use of blind analyses in
	cosmology could help to avoid this.},

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear evolution of density perturbations in cosmologies
	where the late-time accelerated expansion is driven by a quintessence
	field with vanishing speed of sound. For these models matter and
	quintessence perturbations are comoving and it is possible to write
	a single continuity equation for the total density fluctuations given
	by a weighted sum of the two components. Including the Euler equation
	for the common velocity field we solve the evolution equations for
	the nonlinear, total density power spectrum in the Time-Renormalization
	Group approach. In fact any cosmological observable is directly related
	by gravity only to the total density perturbations, with the two
	components being individually unobservable. We show that the clustering
	of quintessence perturbations induces small corrections with respect
	to the nonlinear evolution of power spectrum in smooth quintessence
	models described by the same equation of state. Such small corrections,
	however, contrast with the large effect of a vanishing speed of sound
	on the linear growth function at low redshift. For this reason, models
	with the same normalization of the linear density power spectrum
	can present significantly different nonlinear corrections depending
	on the value of the sound speed. Although such differences vanish
	in the w-->-1, LambdaCDM limit, we argue that the relation between
	linear and nonlinear growth of structures should be properly taken
	into account in constraining models with inhomogeneous dark energy.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological implications of the observed large-scale peculiar velocities
	are reviewed, alone or combined with redshift surveys and CMB data.
	The latest version of the POTENT method for reconstructing the underlying
	three-dimensional velocity and mass-density fields is described.
	The initial fluctuations and the nature of the dark matter are addressed
	via statistics such as bulk flow and mass power spectrum. The focus
	is on constraining the mass density parameter $\Omega$, directly
	or via the parameter $\beta$ which involves the unknown relation
	between galaxies and mass. The acceptable range for $\Omega$ is found
	to be $0.4-1.0$. The range of $\beta$ estimates is likely to reflect
	non-trivial features in the galaxy biasing scheme, such as scale
	dependence. Similar constraints on $\Omega$ and $\Lambda$ from global
	measures are summarized.},

	Abstract = {We were asked to debate the value of the cosmological mass-density
	parameter Omega. Is Omega_m=1 in accordance with the simplest model?
	Is Omega_m much smaller as indicated by some observations? There
	is conflicting evidence. We lay out the various methods for measuring
	Omega_m, mention new developments and current estimates, and focus
	on prospects versus the associated difficulties. We try to shed light
	on the uncertainties that are responsible for the span of estimates
	for Omega_m. We divide the methods into the following four classes:
	a. Global measures of the properties of space-time that constrain
	combinations of Omega_m and the other cosmological parameters (Lambda,
	Ho, to). b. Virialized Systems. Nonlinear dynamics within galaxies
	and clusters on comoving scales 1-10 Mpc/h. c. Large-scale structure.
	Mildly-nonlinear gravitational dynamics of fluctuations on scales
	10-100 Mpc/h, in particular cosmic flows. d. Growth rate of fluctuations
	from the last scattering of the CMB or from high redshift galaxies
	to the present. Methods (b) typically yield low values of Omega_m=0.2-0.3.

	It holds that most of the matter exists in the form of slowly moving

	formation arose from quantum fluctuations around 10-34 seconds after

	Abstract = {We investigate the potential of next-generation surveys of the cosmic
	microwave background and large-scale structure, to constrain the
	nature of dark energy, by means of the cross-correlation of the Integrated
	Sachs-Wolfe effect with the galaxy distribution. We first complete
	a signal-to-noise analysis to decide the most appropriate properties
	of a survey required to detect the correlated signal at a significance
	level of higher than 4sigma. We find that more than 35% of the sky
	should be covered, the galaxy distribution should be probed out to
	a median redshift higher than 0.8, and the number of galaxies detected
	should be higher than a few per squared arcmin. We then consider
	in particular forthcoming surveys DUNE, LSST, SNAP, PanSTARRS. We
	independently compute the constraints that the DUNE survey can place
	on the nature of dark energy, by means of different parametrisations
	of its equation of state, using a standard Fisher matrix analysis.
	We confirm that, with respect to limits placed by pure CMB, cross-correlation
	constraints can help to break the degeneracies between dark energy
	and cosmological parameters. The strength of the constraints is not,
	of course, independent of the dark-energy model. The constraints
	are complementary to, despite being weaker than, some other probes
	of dark energy such as gravitational weak-lensing, because they are
	sensitive to the high-redshift behaviour of the dark energy.},

	Abstract = {Context. One of the main challenges of modern cosmology is to understand
	the nature of the mysterious dark energy that causes the cosmic acceleration.
	The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is sensitive to dark energy,
	and if detected in a universe where modified gravity and curvature
	are excluded, presents an independent signature of dark energy. The
	ISW effect occurs on large scales where cosmic variance is high and
	where owing to the Galactic confusion we lack large amounts of data
	in the CMB as well as large-scale structure maps. Moreover, existing
	methods in the literature often make strong assumptions about the
	statistics of the underlying fields or estimators. Together these
	effects can severely limit signal extraction. Aims: We aim to define
	an optimal statistical method for detecting the ISW effect that can
	handle large areas of missing data and minimise the number of underlying
	assumptions made about the data and estimators. Methods: We first
	review current detections (and non-detections) of the ISW effect,
	comparing statistical subtleties between existing methods, and identifying
	several limitations. We propose a novel method to detect and measure
	the ISW signal. This method assumes only that the primordial CMB
	field is Gaussian. It is based on a sparse inpainting method to reconstruct
	missing data and uses a bootstrap technique to avoid assumptions
	about the statistics of the estimator. It is a complete method, which
	uses three complementary statistical methods. Results: We apply our
	method to Euclid-like simulations and show we can expect a ~7sigma
	model-independent detection of the ISW signal with WMAP7-like data,
	even when considering missing data. Other tests return ~5sigma detection
	levels for a Euclid-like survey. We find that detection levels are
	independent from whether the galaxy field is normally or lognormally
	distributed. We apply our method to the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)
	and WMAP7 CMB data and find detections in the 1.0-1.2sigma range,
	as expected from our simulations. As a by-product, we have also reconstructed
	the full-sky temperature ISW field from the 2MASS data. Conclusions:
	We present a novel technique based on sparse inpainting and bootstrapping,
	which accurately detects and reconstructs the ISW effect.},

@article{eisenstein:2007,
	Abstract = {We discuss the effects of nonlinear structure formation on the signature
	of acoustic oscillations in the late-time galaxy distribution. We
	argue that the dominant nonlinear effect is the differential motion
	of pairs of tracers separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven
	by bulk flows and cluster formation and are much smaller than the
	acoustic scale itself. We present a model for the nonlinear evolution
	based on the distribution of pairwise Lagrangian displacements that
	provides a quantitative model for the degradation of the acoustic
	signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The Lagrangian
	displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly
	smaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise
	power spectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier
	basis with that in the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic
	signature is more robust than the usual Fourier-space intuition would
	suggest, because the beat frequency between the peaks and troughs
	of the acoustic oscillations is a very small wavenumber that is well
	inside the linear regime. We argue that any possible shift of the
	acoustic scale is related to infall on a scale of 150 Mpc, which
	is O(0.5%) fractionally at first order, even at z=0. For the matter,
	there is a first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is O(10-4).
	However, galaxy bias can circumvent this cancellation and produce
	a subpercent systematic bias.},

	Abstract = {Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and
	II), SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three
	scientific themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history
	and structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets
	around other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will
	provide regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS
	Data Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes
	SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest
	pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations.
	This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise
	SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure
	redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Lyalpha forest spectra
	of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature
	of large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of
	the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z < 0.7 and at z
	‚{\^a}{\`a} 2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that
	is the continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding
	and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R = lambda/Deltalambda
	‚{\^a}{\`a} 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in a variety of
	target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar kinematics
	and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter halo from
	the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the Apache
	Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain high-resolution
	(R ‚{\^a}{\`a} 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N >= 100 per
	resolution element), H-band (1.51 mum < lambda < 1.70 mum) spectra
	of 105 evolved, late-type stars, measuring separate abundances for
	~15 elements per star and creating the first high-precision spectroscopic
	survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge, bar, disks, halo)
	with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral diagnostics. The
	Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS)
	will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK stars with the
	sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m s-1, ~24 visits per star) needed
	to detect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an
	unprecedented data set for understanding the formation and dynamical
	evolution of giant planet systems. As of 2011 January, SDSS-III has
	obtained spectra of more than 240,000 galaxies, 29,000 z >= 2.2 quasars,
	and 140,000 stars, including 74,000 velocity measurements of 2580
	stars for MARVELS.},

	Abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic
	sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
	Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h-3 Gpc3 over 3816 deg2 and
	0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale
	structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function
	at 100 h-1 Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted
	shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic
	oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection
	demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability
	between z~1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of
	the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard
	ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35
	and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to
	z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation
	function, we measure the matter density Omegamh2 to 8% and find agreement
	with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.
	Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale,
	we find Omegam=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137OmegaK. Including the
	CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is OmegaK=-0.010+/-0.009
	if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our
	results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence
	an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the
	same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The
	standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust
	tests of its fundamental properties.},

	Abstract = {Models with late-time cosmic acceleration, such as the Lambda-dominated
	cold dark matter model, predict a freeze-out for the growth of linear
	gravitational potential at moderate redshift z < 1, which can be
	observed as temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background
	(CMB): the so-called integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. We present
	a direct measurement of the ISW effect based on the angular cross-correlation
	function, wTG(theta), of CMB temperature anisotropies and dark matter
	fluctuations traced by galaxies. We cross-correlate the first-year
	WMAP data in combination with the APM Galaxy Survey. On the largest
	scales, theta= 4$\,^{\circ}$-10$\,^{\circ}$, we detect a non-vanishing
	cross-correlation at 98.8 per cent significance level, with a 1sigma
	error of wTG= 0.35 +/- 0.14 muK, which favours large values of OmegaLambda~=
	0.8 for flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models. On smaller scales,
	theta < 1$\,^{\circ}$, the correlations disappear. This is contrary
	to what would be expected from the ISW effect, but the absence of
	correlations may be simply explained if the ISW signal was being
	cancelled by anti-correlations arising from the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
	effect.},

	Abstract = {We present a cross-correlation analysis of the W ilkinson Microwave
	Anisotropy Probe cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies
	and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy density fluctuations. We
	find significant detections of the angular CMB-galaxy correlation
	for both a flux-limited galaxy sample (z~0.3) and a high-redshift
	(z~0.5) color-selected sample. The signal is compatible with that
	expected from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect at large angles
	(theta>4deg) and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect at small scales
	(theta<1deg). The detected correlation at low z is in good agreement
	with a previous analysis using the Automated Plate Measuring survey
	(z~0.15). The combined analysis of all three samples yields a total
	significance of better than 3 sigma for the ISW effect and of about
	2.7 sigma for the SZ effect, with a Compton parameter y~=10-6. For
	a given flat Lambda cold dark matter model, the ISW effect depends
	on both the value of OmegaLambda and the galaxy bias b. To break
	this degeneracy, we estimate the bias using the ratio between the
	galaxy and mass autocorrelation functions in each sample. With our
	bias estimation, all samples consistently favor a best-fit dark-energy-dominated

	Abstract = {We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
	Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method,
	the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances,
	and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results
	are based on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance
	methods applied over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis
	presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and
	refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define
	the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent
	HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration,
	(3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for
	incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt
	a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant
	galaxies are measured) of mu0(LMC)=18.50+/-0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New,
	revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which
	Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well
	as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new
	calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement
	with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid
	distances, we find values (in km s-1 Mpc-1) of H0=71+/-2 (random)+/-6
	(systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H0=71+/-3+/-7 (Tully-Fisher relation),
	H0=70+/-5+/-6 (surface brightness fluctuations), H0=72+/-9+/-7 (Type
	II supernovae), and H0=82+/-6+/-9 (fundamental plane). We combine
	these results for the different methods with three different weighting
	schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H0=72+/-8 km
	s-1 Mpc-1. Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods
	for measuring H0. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble
	Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute,
	which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We study the clustering of luminous red galaxies in the latest spectroscopic
	Sloan Digital Sky Survey data releases (DR), DR6 and DR7, which sample
	over 1Gpc3h-3 to z = 0.47. The two-point correlation function xi(sigma,
	pi) is estimated as a function of perpendicular sigma and line-of-sight
	pi (radial) directions. We find significant detection of a peak at
	r ~= 110Mpch-1, which shows as a circular ring in the sigma-pi plane.
	There is also significant evidence of a peak along the radial direction
	whose shape is consistent with its origination from the recombination-epoch
	baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). A xi(sigma, pi) model with no
	radial BAO peak is disfavoured at 3.2sigma, whereas a model with
	no magnification bias is disfavoured at 2sigma. The radial data enable,
	for the first time, a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter
	H(z) as a function of redshift. This is independent of earlier BAO
	measurements which used the spherically averaged (monopole) correlation
	to constrain an integral of H(z). Using the BAO peak position as
	a standard ruler in the radial direction, we find H(z = 0.24) = 79.69
	+/- 2.32 (+/-1.29)kms-1Mpc-1 for z = 0.15-0.30 and H(z = 0.43) =
	86.45 +/- 3.27 (+/-1.69)kms-1Mpc-1 for z = 0.40-0.47. The first error
	is a model-independent statistical estimation and the second accounts
	for systematics both in the measurements and in the model. For the
	full sample, z = 0.15-0.47, we find H(z = 0.34) = 83.80 +/- 2.96

	Abstract = {We reconsider the problem of gravitational structure formation inside
	and outside general relativity (GR), in both the weakly and strongly
	nonlinear regime. We show how these regimes can be explored observationally
	through clustering of high-order cumulants and through the epoch
	of formation, abundance, and clustering of collapse structures, using
	Press-Schechter formalism and its extensions. We address the question
	of how different these predictions are when using a nonstandard theory
	of gravity. We study examples of cosmologies that do not necessarily
	obey Einstein's field equations: scalar-tensor theories (STT), such
	as Brans-Dicke (BD), parametrized with omega, a nonstandard parameterization
	of the Hubble law, H2=a-3(1+{\OE}µ), or a nonstandard cosmic equation
	of state p=gammarho, where gamma can be chosen irrespective of the
	cosmological parameters (OmegaM and OmegaLambda). We present some
	preliminary bounds on gamma, omega, and {\OE}µ from observations
	of the skewness and kurtosis in the Automated Plate Measuring (APM)
	Galaxy Survey. This test is independent of the overall normalization
	of rms fluctuations. We also show how abundances and formation times
	change under these assumptions. Upcoming data on nonlinear growth
	will place strong constraints on such variations from the standard
	paradigm.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the state of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect measurements
	in light of newly available data and address criticisms about the
	measurements which have recently been raised. We update the data
	set previously assembled by Giannantonio et al. to include new data
	releases for both the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale
	structure of the Universe. We find that our updated results are consistent
	with previous measurements. By fitting a single template amplitude,
	we now obtain a combined significance of the ISW detection at the
	4.4sigma level, which fluctuates by {\`A}{\'u}0.4sigma when alternative
	data cuts and analysis assumptions are considered. We also make new
	tests for systematic contaminations of the data, focusing in particular
	on the issues raised by Sawangwit et al. Amongst them, we address
	the rotation test, which aims at checking for possible systematics
	by correlating pairs of randomly rotated maps. We find results consistent
	with the expected data covariance, no evidence for enhanced correlation
	on any preferred axis of rotation, and therefore no indication of
	any additional systematic contamination. We publicly release the
	results, the covariance matrix and the sky maps used to obtain them.},

	Abstract = {We present a global measurement of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
	effect obtained by cross correlating all relevant large-scale galaxy
	data sets with the cosmic microwave background radiation map provided
	by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. With these measurements,
	the overall ISW signal is detected at the {\`A}{\'u}4.5sigma level.
	We also examine the cosmological implications of these measurements,
	particularly the dark energy equation of state w, its sound speed
	cs, and the overall curvature of the Universe. The flat LambdaCDM
	model is a good fit to the data and, assuming this model, we find
	that the ISW data constrain Omegam=0.20-0.11+0.19 at the 95% confidence
	level. When we combine our ISW results with the latest baryon oscillation
	and supernovae measurements, we find that the result is still consistent
	with a flat LambdaCDM model with w=-1 out to redshifts z>1.},

	Abstract = {We present a new estimate of foreground emission in the Wilkinson
	Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, using a Markov chain Monte
	Carlo method. The new technique delivers maps of each foreground
	component for a variety of foreground models with estimates of the
	uncertainty of each foreground component, and it provides an overall
	goodness-of-fit estimate. The resulting foreground maps are in broad
	agreement with those from previous techniques used both within the
	collaboration and by other authors. We find that for WMAP data, a
	simple model with power-law synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust
	components fits 90% of the sky with a reduced chi2 nu of 1.14. However,
	the model does not work well inside the Galactic plane. The addition
	of either synchrotron steepening or a modified spinning dust model
	improves the fit. This component may account for up to 14% of the
	total flux at the Ka band (33 GHz). We find no evidence for foreground
	contamination of the cosmic microwave background temperature map
	in the 85% of the sky used for cosmological analysis. WMAP is the
	result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard
	Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP
	Science Team.},

	Abstract = {The power spectrum of density fluctuations is a foundational source
	of cosmological information. Precision cosmological probes targeted
	primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical
	determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To
	exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy
	demands on the theory are at the 1% level or better. Numerical simulations
	are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled
	predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost
	of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining
	predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological
	parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide
	a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of
	state, "wCDM", cosmologies. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
	limited set of only 37 cosmological models---the "Coyote Universe"
	suite---can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum
	to 1% over a prior parameter range set by current cosmic microwave
	background observations. This paper is the second in a series of
	three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme
	for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.},

	Abstract = {Near-future cosmological observations targeted at investigations of
	dark energy pose stringent requirements on the accuracy of theoretical
	predictions for the nonlinear clustering of matter. Currently, N-body
	simulations comprise the only viable approach to this problem. In
	this paper, we study various sources of computational error and methods
	to control them. By applying our methodology to a large suite of
	cosmological simulations we show that results for the (gravity-only)
	nonlinear matter power spectrum can be obtained at 1% accuracy out
	to k ~ 1 h Mpc-1. The key components of these high accuracy simulations
	are precise initial conditions, very large simulation volumes, sufficient
	mass resolution, and accurate time stepping. This paper is the first
	in a series of three; the final aim is a high-accuracy prediction
	scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum that improves current
	fitting formulae by an order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) will outfit
	the 10 m HET with a new wide field and an array of 150 integral-field
	spectrographs to survey a 420 deg^2 area in the north Galactic cap.
	Each fiber-coupled unit spectrograph will cover 350-550 nm, simultaneously.
	This instrument, called VIRUS, will produce {\`A}{\'u}34,000 spectra
	per exposure, and will open up the emission-line universe to large
	surveys for the first time. The survey will detect 0.8 million Lyman-alpha
	emitting (LAE) galaxies with 1.9<z<3.5 and more than a million [OII]
	emitting galaxies with z<0.5. The 3-D map of LAE galaxies in 9 cubic
	Gpc volume will be used to measure the expansion history at this
	early epoch using baryonic acoustic oscillations and the shape of
	the power spectrum. The aim of HETDEX is to provide a direct detection
	of dark energy at z{\`A}{\'u}3. The measurement will constrain the
	evolution of dark energy and will also provide 0.1%-level accuracy
	on the curvature of the Universe, ten times better than current.
	The prototype of the VIRUS unit spectrograph (VIRUS-P) is a powerful
	instrument in its own right. Used on the McDonald 2.7~m, it covers
	the largest area of any integral field spectrograph, and reaches
	wavelengths down to 340 nm. VIRUS-P is being used for a pilot survey
	to better measure the properties of LAE galaxies in support of HETDEX.
	We report initial results from this survey.},

@article{hirata:2007,
	Abstract = {Correlations between intrinsic shear and the density field on large
	scales, a potentially important contaminant for cosmic shear surveys,
	have been robustly detected at low redshifts with bright galaxies
	in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Here we present a more detailed
	characterization of this effect, which can cause anticorrelations
	between gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic ellipticity (GI
	correlations). This measurement uses 36278 luminous red galaxies
	(LRGs) from the SDSS spectroscopic sample with 0.15 < z < 0.35, split
	by redshift and luminosity; 7758 LRGs from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO
	(2SLAQ) survey at 0.4 < z < 0.8; and a variety of other SDSS samples
	from previous, related work. We find >3sigma detections of the effect
	on large scales (up to 60h-1Mpc) for all galaxy subsamples within
	the SDSS LRG sample; for the 2SLAQ sample, we find a 2sigma detection
	for a bright subsample, and no detection for a fainter subsample.
	Fitting formulae are provided for the scaling of the GI correlations
	with luminosity, transverse separation and redshift (for which the
	2SLAQ sample, while small, provides crucial constraints due to its
	longer baseline in redshift). We estimate contamination in the measurement
	of sigma8 for future cosmic shear surveys on the basis of the fitted
	dependence of GI correlations on galaxy properties. We find contamination
	to the power spectrum ranging from -1.5 per cent (optimistic) to
	-33 per cent (pessimistic) for a toy cosmic shear survey using all
	galaxies to a depth of R = 24 using scales l ~ 500, though the central
	value of predicted contamination is -6.5 per cent. This corresponds
	to a bias in sigma8 of Deltasigma8 = -0.004 (optimistic), -0.02 (central)
	or -0.10 (pessimistic). We provide a prescription for inclusion of
	this error in cosmological parameter estimation codes. The principal
	uncertainty is in the treatment of the L <= L* blue galaxies, for
	which we have no detection of the GI signal, but which could dominate
	the GI contamination if their GI amplitude is near our upper limits.
	Characterization of the tidal alignments of these galaxies, especially
	at redshifts relevant for cosmic shear, should be a high priority
	for the cosmic shear community.},

	Abstract = {We cross correlate large-scale structure (LSS) observations from a
	number of surveys with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
	from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) to investigate
	the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect as a function of redshift,
	covering z{\`A}{\'u}0.1 2.5. Our main goal is to go beyond reporting
	detections towards developing a reliable likelihood analysis that
	allows one to determine cosmological constraints from ISW observations.
	With this in mind we spend a considerable amount of effort in determining
	the redshift-dependent bias and redshift distribution (b(z)√{\'o}dN/dz)
	of these samples by matching with spectroscopic observations where
	available, and analyzing autopower spectra and cross-power spectra
	between the samples. Because of wide redshift distributions of some
	of the data sets we do not assume a constant-bias model, in contrast
	to previous work on this subject. We only use the LSS data sets for
	which we can extract such information reliably and as a result the
	data sets we use are 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) samples, Sloan
	Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric Luminous Red Galaxies, SDSS
	photometric quasars, and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio sources.
	We make a joint analysis of all samples constructing a full covariance
	matrix, which we subsequently use for cosmological parameter fitting.
	We report a 3.7sigma detection of ISW combining all the data sets.
	We do not find significant evidence for an ISW signal at z>1, in
	agreement with theoretical expectation in the LambdaCDM model. We
	combine the ISW likelihood function with weak lensing of CMB (hereafter
	Paper II [C. M. Hirata, S. Ho, N. Padmanabhan, U. Seljak, and N.
	A. Bahcall, arXiv:0801.0644.]) and CMB power spectrum to constrain
	the equation of state of dark energy and the curvature of the Universe.
	While ISW does not significantly improve the constraints in the simplest
	six-parameter flat LambdaCDM model, it improves constraints on seven-parameter
	models with curvature by a factor of 3.2 (relative to WMAP alone)
	to OmegaK=-0.004-0.020+0.014, and with dark energy equation of state
	by 15% to w=-1.01-0.40+0.30 [posterior median with ``1sigma'' (16th
	84th percentile) range]. A software package for calculating the ISW
	likelihood function can be downloaded at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~shirley/ISW_WL.html.},

	Abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the intervening large-scale structure
	of the universe induces high-order correlations in the cosmic microwave
	background temperature and polarization fields. We construct minimum
	variance estimators of the intervening mass distribution out of the
	six quadratic combinations of the temperature and polarization fields.
	Polarization begins to assist in the reconstruction when E-mode mapping
	becomes possible on degree-scale fields, i.e., for an experiment
	with a noise level of ~40 muK arcmin and beam of ~7', similar to
	the Planck experiment; surpasses the temperature reconstruction at
	~26 muK arcmin and 4' and yet continues to improve the reconstruction
	until the lensing B-modes are mapped to l~2000 at ~0.3 muK arcmin
	and 3'. Ultimately, the correlation between the E- and B-modes can
	provide a high signal-to-noise ratio mass map out to multipoles of
	L~1000, extending the range of temperature-based estimators by nearly
	an order of magnitude. We outline four applications of mass reconstruction:
	measurement of the linear power spectrum in projection to the cosmic
	variance limit out to L~1000 (or wavenumbers 0.002<~k<~0.2 in h Mpc-1),
	cross-correlation with cosmic shear surveys to probe the evolution

	maps to probe the dark energy, and the separation of lensing and

	Abstract = {Through analytic techniques verified by numerical calculations, we
	establish general relations between the matter and cosmic microwave
	background (CMB) power spectra and their dependence on parameters
	on small scales. Fluctuations in the CMB, baryons, cold dark matter
	(CDM), and neutrinos receive a boost at horizon crossing. Baryon
	drag on the photons causes alternating acoustic peak heights in the
	CMB and is uncovered in its bare form under the photon diffusion
	scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the baryons
	at the end of the Compton drag epoch freezes the diffusion-damped
	acoustic oscillations into the CMB and matter power spectra at different
	scales. We determine the dependence of the respective acoustic amplitudes
	and damping lengths on fundamental cosmological parameters. The baryonic
	oscillations, enhanced by the velocity overshoot effect, compete
	with CDM fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present
	new exact analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations
	in the presence of a growth-inhibiting radiation and baryon background.
	Combined with the acoustic contributions and baryonic infall into
	CDM potential wells, this provides a highly accurate analytic form
	of the small-scale transfer function in the general case.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that a subelectronvolt upper limit can be derived on the
	neutrino mass from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data alone
	in the LambdaCDM model with the power-law adiabatic perturbations,
	without the aid of any other cosmological data. Assuming the flatness
	of the Universe, the constraint we can derive from the current Wilkinson
	Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations is ‚{\`a}{\"e}<under></under>mnu<2.0
	eV at the 95% confidence level for the sum over three species of
	neutrinos (mnu<0.66 eV for the degenerate neutrinos) by maximizing
	the likelihood over six other cosmological parameters. This constraint
	modifies little even if we abandon the flatness assumption for the
	spatial curvature. We argue that it would be difficult to improve
	the limit much beyond ‚{\`a}{\"e}<under></under>mnu‚{\^a}≤1.5 eV
	using only the CMB data, even if their statistics are substantially
	improved. However, a significant improvement of the limit is possible
	if an external input is introduced that constrains the Hubble constant
	from below. The parameter correlation and the mechanism of CMB perturbations
	that give rise to the limit on the neutrino mass are also elucidated.},

@article{ilic:2013,
	Abstract = {The stacking of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) patches has been
	recently used to detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (iSW).
	Focusing on the locations of superstructures they identified in the
	Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Granett et al. (2008a) found a signal
	with strong significance and an amplitude reportedly higher than
	expected within the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm. We revisit the analysis
	using our own robust protocol, and extend the study to the two most
	recent and largest catalogues of voids publicly available (Pan et
	al. 2012, Sutter et al. 2012). We quantify and subtract the level
	of foreground contamination in the stacked images and we determine
	the contribution on the largest angular scales from the first multipoles
	of the CMB. We obtain the radial temperature and photometry profiles
	from the stacked images. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we compute
	for each catalogue the statistical significance of the profiles and
	identify the angular scale at which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
	is maximal. While we essentially confirm the signal detection reported
	by Granett et al., we do not find anything significant with the other
	two catalogues. A rescaling of the voids to the same size on the
	stacked image does not improve the results. We stress the importance
	of a posteriori selection effects that might arise when intending
	to increase the SNR, and we discuss the possible impact of void overlap
	and alignment effects. We argue that the interpretation in terms
	of an iSW effect of any detected signal via the stacking method is
	far from obvious.},

	Abstract = {Cosmological probes are steadily reducing the total neutrino mass
	window, resulting in constraints on the neutrino-mass degeneracy
	as the most significant outcome. In this work we explore the discovery
	potential of cosmological probes to constrain the neutrino hierarchy,
	and point out some subtleties that could yield spurious claims of
	detection. This has an important implication for next generation
	of double beta decay experiments, that will be able to achieve a
	positive signal in the case of degenerate or inverted hierarchy of
	Majorana neutrinos. We find that cosmological experiments that nearly

	Abstract = {We present estimates of the gravitational lensing shear variance obtained
	from images taken at the CFHT using the UH8K CCD mosaic camera. Six
	fields were observed for a total of 1 hour each in V and I, resulting
	in catalogs containing approximately 20,000$ galaxies per field,
	with properly calibrated and optimally weighted shear estimates.
	These were averaged in cells of sizes ranging from 1'.875 to 30'
	to obtain estimates of the cosmic shear variance $<\bar{\gamma}^2>$,
	with uncertainty estimated from the scatter among the estimates for
	the 6 fields. Our most reliable estimator for cosmic shear is provided
	by the cross-correlation of the shear measured in the two passbands.
	At scales $\lsim 10'$ the results are in good agreement with those
	of van Waerbeke et al. 2000, Bacon et al. 2000 and Wittman et al.
	2000 and with currently fashionable cosmological models. At larger
	scales the shear variance falls below the theoretical predictions,

	Abstract = {[abridged] The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming
	from simulations of cosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated
	tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the art of object
	finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important
	discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety
	of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained
	as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information
	about the structures of interest. This concern gave rise to a series
	of workshops and comparison papers of which we here present a brief
	summary. But we also go one step further and investigate in more
	detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To
	this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,
	clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo
	properties. We observe that different codes not only find different
	numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the
	halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those
	objects that are identified by all finders differ. [...] We close
	with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter
	across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy
	formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.
	In summary we conclude that while the majority of codes give results
	with a scatter below 1 per cent (at least for the most basic halo
	properties) once a particular definition has been specified, the
	residual differences for more complex quantities such as spin parameter
	are more sensitive to the particular implementation of the initial
	particle collection. We therefore caution any user of halo finders
	and their catalogues to not use the data blindly but to consider
	the mode of operation and definitions used during its generation.},

	Abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical
	data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places
	new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining
	the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon
	acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the
	Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of
	the simplest six-parameter LambdaCDM model. The power-law index of
	the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 $\pm$ 0.012 (68% CL)
	for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles
	spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond
	the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the
	five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal
	model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination
	of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination
	of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples
	of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ‚{\`a}{\"e}m
	nu < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species,
	N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations
	of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation
	of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type
	Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect
	of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide
	a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 $\pm$
	0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time,
	the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold
	spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical
	processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations.
	The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we
	now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum
	at 21sigma, compared with 13sigma from the five-year data. With the
	seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on
	a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating
	effects has improved by 38% to Delta alpha =-1.1$\pm$ 1.4$\,^{\circ}$
	statistical $\pm$ 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant
	detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations
	of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well
	with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster
	basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from
	"universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical
	simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant
	difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters
	(or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of
	the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically
	expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope
	Collaboration. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton
	University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance
	is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

@article{komatsu:2001,
	Abstract = {If the primordial fluctuations are non-Gaussian, then this non-Gaussianity
	will be apparent in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky. With
	their sensitive all-sky observation, MAP and Planck satellites should
	be able to detect weak non-Gaussianity in the CMB sky. On a large
	angular scale, there is a simple relationship between the CMB temperature
	and the primordial curvature perturbation: DeltaT/T=-Phi/3. On smaller
	scales, however, the radiation transfer function becomes more complex.
	In this paper, we present the angular bispectrum of the primary CMB
	anisotropy that uses the full transfer function. We find that the
	bispectrum has a series of acoustic peaks that change a sign and
	a period of acoustic oscillations is twice as long as that of the
	angular power spectrum. Using a single non-linear coupling parameter
	to characterize the amplitude of the bispectrum, we estimate the
	expected signal-to-noise ratio for COBE, MAP, and Planck experiments.
	In order to detect the primary CMB bispectrum by each experiment,
	we find that the coupling parameter should be larger than 600, 20,
	and 5 for COBE, MAP, and Planck experiments, respectively. Even for
	the ideal noise-free and infinitesimal thin-beam experiment, the
	parameter should be larger than 3. We have included effects from
	the cosmic variance, detector noise, and foreground sources in the
	signal-to-noise estimation. Since the simple inflationary scenarios
	predict that the parameter is an order of 0.01, the detection of
	the primary bispectrum by any kind of experiments should be problematic
	for those scenarios. We compare the sensitivity of the primary bispectrum
	to the primary skewness and conclude that, when we can compute the
	predicted form of the bispectrum, it becomes a ``matched filter''
	for detecting the non-Gaussianity in the data and a much more powerful
	tool than the skewness. For example, we need the coupling parameter
	of larger than 800, 80, 70, and 60 for each relevant experiment in
	order to detect the primary skewness. We also show that MAP and Planck
	can separate the primary bispectrum from various secondary bispectra
	on the basis of the shape difference. The primary CMB bispectrum
	is a test of the inflationary scenario and also a probe of the non-linear
	physics in the very early universe.},

	Abstract = {We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new
	data set of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe, and new analysis
	procedures to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This ``Union''
	compilation of 414 SNe Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection
	cuts, includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova
	Legacy Survey and ESSENCE Survey, the older data sets, as well as
	the recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with
	the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A single, consistent, and blind
	analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples,
	and a new procedure is implemented that consistently weights the
	heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest
	results from this Union compilation and discuss the cosmological
	constraints from this new compilation and its combination with other
	cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain
	from supernovae on the dark energy density is OmegaLambda=0.713+0.027-0.029(stat)+0.036-0.039(sys),
	for a flat, LambdaCDM universe. Assuming a constant equation of state
	parameter, w, the combined constraints from SNe, BAO, and CMB give
	w=-0.969+0.059-0.063(stat)+0.063-0.066(sys). While our results are
	consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively
	weak constraints on a w that varies with redshift. In particular,
	the current SN data do not yet significantly constrain w at z>1.
	With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these resulting
	cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available.},

@inproceedings{lvov:1995,
	Abstract = {The lectures presented by one of us (IP) at the Les Houches summer
	school dealt with the scaling properties of high Reynolds number
	turbulence in fluid flows. The results presented are available in
	the literature and there is no real need to reproduce them here.
	Quite on the contrary, some of the basic tools of the field and theoretical
	techniques are not available in a pedagogical format, and it seems
	worthwhile to present them here for the benefit of the interested
	student. We begin with a detailed exposition of the naive perturbation
	theory for the ensemble averages of hydrodynamic observables (the
	mean velocity, the response functions and the correlation functions).
	The effective expansion parameter in such a theory is the Reynolds
	number (Re); one needs therefore to perform infinite resummations
	to change the effective expansion parameter. We present in detail
	the Dyson-Wyld line resummation which allows one to dress the propagators,
	and to change the effective expansion parameter from Re to O(1).
	Next we develop the ``dressed vertex" representation of the diagrammatic
	series. Lastly we discuss in full detail the path-integral formulation
	of the statistical theory of turbulence, and show that it is equivalent
	order by order to the Dyson-Wyld theory. On the basis of the material
	presented here one can proceed smoothly to read the recent developments
	in this field.},

@article{WMAP7-2,
	Abstract = {The WMAP mission has produced sky maps from seven years of observations
	at L2. We present the angular power spectra derived from the seven-year
	maps and discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred
	from WMAP data alone. With the seven-year data, the temperature (TT)
	spectrum measurement has a signal-to-noise ratio per multipole that
	exceeds unity for l < 919; and in band powers of width Deltal = 10,
	the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds unity up to l = 1060. The third
	acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP. In
	the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us
	to place tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data
	alone, Omega m h 2 = 0.1334+0.0056 -0.0055, and on the epoch of matter-radiation
	equality, z eq = 3196+134 -133. The temperature-polarization (TE)
	spectrum is detected in the seven-year data with a significance of
	20sigma, compared to 13sigma with the five-year data. We now detect
	the second dip in the TE spectrum near l ~ 450 with high confidence.
	The TB and EB spectra remain consistent with zero, thus demonstrating
	low systematic errors and foreground residuals in the data. The low-l
	EE spectrum, a measure of the optical depth due to reionization,
	is detected at 5.5sigma significance when averaged over l = 2-7:
	l(l + 1)C EE l /(2pi) = 0.074+0.034 -0.025 muK2 (68% CL). We now
	detect the high-l, 24 <= l <= 800, EE spectrum at over 8sigma. The
	BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from inflation,
	remains consistent with zero; when averaged over l = 2-7, l(l + 1)C
	BB l /(2pi) < 0.055 muK2 (95% CL). The upper limit on tensor modes
	from polarization data alone is a factor of two lower with the seven-year
	data than it was using the five-year data. The data remain consistent
	with the simple LambdaCDM model: the best-fit TT spectrum has an
	effective chi2 of 1227 for 1170 degrees of freedom, with a probability
	to exceed of 9.6%. The allowable volume in the six-dimensional space
	of LambdaCDM parameters has been reduced by a factor of 1.5 relative
	to the five-year volume, while the LambdaCDM model that allows for
	tensor modes and a running scalar spectral index has a factor of
	three lower volume when fit to the seven-year data. We test the parameter
	recovery process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index,
	ns , is biased high, but only by 0.09sigma, while the remaining parameters
	are biased by <0.15sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement
	leads to tighter lower limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic
	degrees of freedom (e.g., neutrinos) in the early universe: N eff>2.7(95%CL).
	Also, using WMAP data alone, the primordial helium mass fraction
	is found to be Y He = 0.28+0.14 -0.15, and with data from higher-resolution
	cosmic microwave background experiments included, we now establish
	the existence of pre-stellar helium at >3sigma. These new WMAP measurements
	provide important tests of big bang cosmology. WMAP is the result
	of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard
	Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP
	Science Team.},

	Abstract = {Euclid is a proposed high-precision survey mission to map the geometry
	of the Dark Universe with demonstrated feasibility. Euclid's Visible
	- Near-InfraRed imaging and spectroscopy of the extragalactic sky
	will further produce extensive legacy science to the boundaries of
	the visible universe. The mission is optimised for two primary cosmological
	probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations
	(BAO). Euclid's wide survey will cover 20,000 deg2, measuring shapes
	and redshifts of galaxies to redshift 2. For weak lensing, Euclid
	will measure the shape of over 2 billion galaxies with a density
	of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z
	band (550-920 nm) down to AB mag 24.5 (10sigma). The photometric
	redshifts for these galaxies are derived from three additional Euclid
	NIR bands (Y,J,H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron) reaching AB mag 24
	(5sigma) in each, complemented by photometry from ground based surveys.
	The BAO are determined from a NIR spectroscopic survey with a redshift
	accuracy of dz/(1+z) =0.001. The baseline payload consists of a Korsch
	telescope with a primary mirror of 1.2 m diameter and is designed
	to provide a large field of view (0.5 deg2) to three scientific instruments:
	(1) VIS: a CCD based optical imaging channel, (2) NIP: a NIR imaging
	photometry channel, and (3) NIS: a NIR spectrometric channel. This
	report presents an overview of the assessment study phase of the
	Euclid candidate M-class Cosmic Vision mission; it will provide a
	description of the Euclid science objectives, the mission implementation
	and payload, and the envisaged data handling.},

	Abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency
	designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating
	expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature
	of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational
	signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history
	of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent
	primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and
	Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists
	of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of
	view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54
	deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP)
	which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer.
	The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic
	sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid
	measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one
	broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts
	for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are
	derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range
	0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible
	bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations.
	The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift
	accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral
	resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies.
	Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025

	Abstract = {Many of the most exciting questions in astrophysics and cosmology,
	including the majority of observational probes of dark energy, rely
	on an understanding of the nonlinear regime of structure formation.
	In order to fully exploit the information available from this regime
	and to extract cosmological constraints, accurate theoretical predictions
	are needed. Currently, such predictions can only be obtained from
	costly, precision numerical simulations. This paper is the third
	in a series aimed at constructing an accurate calibration of the
	nonlinear mass power spectrum on Mpc scales for a wide range of currently
	viable cosmological models, including dark energy models with w !=
	-1. The first two papers addressed the numerical challenges and the
	scheme by which an interpolator was built from a carefully chosen
	set of cosmological models. In this paper, we introduce the "Coyote
	Universe" simulation suite which comprises nearly 1000 N-body simulations
	at different force and mass resolutions, spanning 38 w CDM cosmologies.
	This large simulation suite enables us to construct a prediction
	scheme, or emulator, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate
	at the percent level out to k ~= 1 h Mpc-1. We describe the construction
	of the emulator, explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy,
	and discuss how the central ideas may be extended to a wider range
	of cosmological models and applications. A power spectrum emulator
	code is released publicly as part of this paper.},

	Abstract = {Future large scale structure observations are expected to be sensitive
	to small neutrino masses, of the order of 0.05 eV or more. However,
	forecasts are based on the assumption that by the time at which these
	datasets will be available, the non-linear spectrum in presence of
	neutrino mass will be predicted with an accuracy at least equal to
	the neutrino mass effect itself, i.e. about 3%. Motivated by these
	considerations, we present the computation of the non-linear power
	spectrum of LambdaCDM models in the presence of massive neutrinos
	using the Renormalization Group (RG) time-flow approach, which amounts
	to a resummation of perturbative corrections to the matter power
	spectrum to all orders. We compare our results with those obtained
	with other methods, i.e. linear theory, one-loop perturbation theory
	and N-body simulations and show that the time-RG method improves
	the one-loop method in fitting the N-body data, especially in determining
	the suppression of the matter power spectrum when neutrino are massive
	with respect to the linear power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Modelling of the weak lensing of the CMB will be crucial to obtain
	correct cosmological parameter constraints from forthcoming precision
	CMB anisotropy observations. The lensing affects the power spectrum
	as well as inducing non-Gaussianities. We discuss the simulation
	of full-sky CMB maps in the weak lensing approximation and describe
	a fast numerical code. The series expansion in the deflection angle
	cannot be used to simulate accurate CMB maps, so a pixel remapping
	must be used. For parameter estimation accounting for the change
	in the power spectrum but assuming Gaussianity is sufficient to obtain
	accurate results up to Planck sensitivity using current tools. A
	fuller analysis may be required to obtain accurate error estimates
	and for more sensitive observations. We demonstrate a simple full-sky
	simulation and subsequent parameter estimation at Planck-like sensitivity.
	The lensed CMB simulation and parameter estimation codes are publicly

@article{lewis:2011,
	Abstract = {Lensing of the CMB generates a significant bispectrum, which should
	be detected by the Planck satellite at the 5-sigma level and is potentially
	a non-negligible source of bias for fNL estimators of local non-Gaussianity.
	We extend current understanding of the lensing bispectrum in several
	directions: (1) we perform a non-perturbative calculation of the
	lensing bispectrum which is ~ 10% more accurate than previous, first-order
	calculations; (2) we demonstrate how to incorporate the signal variance
	of the lensing bispectrum into estimates of its amplitude, providing
	a good analytical explanation for previous Monte-Carlo results; and
	(3) we discover the existence of a significant lensing bispectrum
	in polarization, due to a previously-unnoticed correlation between
	the lensing potential and E-polarization as large as 30% at low multipoles.
	We use this improved understanding of the lensing bispectra to re-evaluate
	Fisher-matrix predictions, both for Planck and cosmic variance limited
	data. We confirm that the non-negligible lensing-induced bias for
	estimation of local non-Gaussianity should be robustly treatable,
	and will only inflate fNL error bars by a few percent over predictions
	where lensing effects are completely ignored (but note that lensing
	must still be accounted for to obtain unbiased constraints). We also
	show that the detection significance for the lensing bispectrum itself
	is ultimately limited to 9 sigma by cosmic variance. The tools that
	we develop for non-perturbative calculation of the lensing bispectrum
	are directly relevant to other calculations, and we give an explicit
	construction of a simple non-perturbative quadratic estimator for
	the lensing potential and relate its cross-correlation power spectrum
	to the bispectrum. Our numerical codes are publicly available as
	part of CAMB and LensPix.},

@article{Liddle:1993fq,
	Abstract = {The outstanding problem in cosmology today is undoubtedly the origin
	and evolution of large scale structure. In this context, no model
	has proved as successful as the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model,
	based on a flat (scale-invariant) spectrum of density fluctuations
	growing under gravitational instability. Nevertherless, pressure
	has recently been exerted on the model both from analyses of large
	scale clustering in the galaxy distribution and from the measurement
	of the level of microwave background anisotropies by the Cosmic Background
	Explorer (COBE) satellite. In this report we aim to give a unified
	view of the Cold Dark Matter model, beginning with the creation of
	perturbations during an inflationary epoch and pursuing it right
	through to comparison with a host of observations. We discuss in
	detail the evolution of density perturbations in Friedmann universes,
	utilising the fluid flow approach pioneered by Hawking, and provide
	a simple derivation of the Sachs-Wolfe effect giving large angle
	microwave background anisotropies. We illustrate the means by which
	inflation provides an initial spectrum of inhomogeneities, the spectrum
	having a shape which can be readily calculated in a given inflationary
	model. We also include a discussion of the generation of long wavelength
	gravitational waves, which have recently been recognised as having
	a potentially important role with regard to microwave background
	anisotropies. Although the standard CDM model is based on a scale-invariant
	spectrum, the generic prediction of simple inflationary models is
	for a power-law spectrum, tilted away from scale invariance to provide
	extra large scale power. For many models such as chaotic inflation,
	this tilting is rather modest. However, in several models, such as
	power-law inflation, extended inflation and natural inflation, the
	tilting of the spectrum can be more dramatic, and potentially useful
	in the light of observations indicating a deficit of large scale
	power in the galaxy distribution. In the former two of these, there
	is the interesting extra of a substantial production of gravitational
	waves. We then discuss observational constraints on cold dark matter
	cosmogonies based on power-law spectra. We examine a range of phenomena,
	including large angle microwave background fluctuations, clustering
	in the galaxy distribution, peculiar velocity flows, the formation
	of high redshift quasars and the epoch of structure formation. One
	of our aims is to compute the current constraints on both the shape
	of the spectrum as defined by the spectral index n, and its normalisation
	as defined by the usual quantity sigma8 1/b8. We end by discussing
	briefly some variants on the CDM model, such as the incorporation
	of a hot dark matter component, or the introduction of a cosmological
	constant term. We do not, however, investigate them in the depth
	that we do the tilted CDM models, though the techniques illustrated
	throughout the paper provide the background required for suvh an
	undertaking.},

	for the 2nd order correction to the Limber formula, which improves
	the accuracy to O(l-4). This correction can be especially useful
	for narrow redshift bins, or samples with small redshift overlap,
	for which the 0th order Limber formula has a large error. We also

	Abstract = {Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) measurements, which involve cross-correlating
	the microwave background anisotropies with the foreground large-scale
	structure (e.g. traced by galaxies/quasars), have proven to be an
	interesting probe of dark energy. We show that magnification bias,
	which is the inevitable modulation of the foreground number counts
	by gravitational lensing, alters both the scale dependence and amplitude
	of the observed ISW signal. This is true especially at high redshifts
	because (1) the intrinsic galaxy-temperature signal diminishes greatly
	back in the matter-dominated era, (2) the lensing efficiency increases
	with redshift and (3) the number count slope generally steepens with
	redshift in a magnitude limited sample. At z‚{\^a}≥2, the magnification-temperature
	correlation dominates over the intrinsic galaxy-temperature correlation
	and causes the observed ISW signal to increase with redshift, despite
	dark energy subdominance---a result of the fact that magnification
	probes structures all the way from the observer to the sources. Ignoring
	magnification bias therefore can lead to (significantly) erroneous
	conclusions about dark energy. While the lensing modulation opens
	up an interesting high z window for ISW measurements, high redshift
	measurements are not expected to add much new information to low
	redshift ones if dark energy is indeed the cosmological constant.
	This is because lensing introduces significant covariance across
	redshifts. The most compelling reasons for pursuing high redshift
	ISW measurements are to look for potential surprises such as early
	dark energy domination or signatures of modified gravity. We conclude
	with a discussion of existing measurements, the highest redshift
	of which is at the margin of being sensitive to the magnification
	effect. We also develop a formalism which might be of more general
	interest: to predict biases in estimating parameters when certain
	physical effects are ignored in interpreting observations.},

	Abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields
	to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting
	science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey
	Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and
	an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg^2, and will be devoted
	to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg^2 south of +15 deg.
	Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures
	in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source
	depth of r~27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters
	of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses
	educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe
	a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the
	inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way
	and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo
	and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects
	both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active
	galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological
	topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z~1, strong and weak
	lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations,
	and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological
	models and the physics of dark energy.},

	Abstract = {The nature of the fuel that drives today's cosmic acceleration is
	an open and tantalizing mystery. We entertain the suggestion that
	the acceleration is not the manifestation of yet another new ingredient
	in the cosmic gas tank, but rather a signal of our first real lack
	of understanding of gravitational physics. By requiring that the
	underlying gravity theory respect Birkhoff's law, we derive the modified
	gravitational force law necessary to generate any given cosmology,
	without reference to the fundamental theory, revealing modifications
	of gravity at scales typically much smaller than today's horizon.
	We discuss how, through these modifications, the growth of density
	perturbations, the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, and even
	solar-system measurements may be sensitive to whether today's cosmic
	acceleration is generated by dark energy or modified gravitational
	dynamics, and are subject to imminent observational discrimination.
	We argue how these conclusions can be more generic, and probably
	not dependent on the validity of Birkhoff's law.},

	Abstract = {We provide an exhaustive analysis of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
	effect in the context of coupled dark energy cosmologies where a
	component of massive neutrinos is also present. We focus on the effects
	of both the coupling between dark matter and dark energy and of the
	neutrino mass on the cross-correlation between galaxy/quasar distributions
	and ISW effect. We provide a simple expression to appropriately rescale
	the galaxy bias when comparing different cosmologies. Theoretical
	predictions of the cross-correlation function are then compared with
	observational data. We find that, while it is not possible to distinguish
	among the models at low redshifts, discrepancies between coupled
	models and LambdaCDM increase with z. In spite of this, current data
	alone does not seem able to distinguish between coupled models and
	LambdaCDM. However, we show that upcoming galaxy surveys will permit
	tomographic analysis that will allow us to better discriminate among
	the models. We discuss the effects on cross-correlation measurements
	of ignoring galaxy bias evolution, b(z), and magnification bias correction
	and provide fitting formulae for b(z) for the cosmologies considered.
	We compare three different tomographic schemes and investigate how
	the expected signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of the ISW-LSS cross-correlation
	changes when increasing the number of tomographic bins. The dependence
	of S/N on the area of the survey and the survey shot noise is also
	discussed.},

@article{mantz:2010,
	Abstract = {This is the fourth of a series of papers in which we derive simultaneous
	constraints on cosmological parameters and X-ray scaling relations
	using observations of the growth of massive, X-ray flux-selected
	galaxy clusters. Our data set consists of 238 clusters drawn from
	the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and incorporates extensive follow-up observations
	using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Here we examine the constraints
	on neutrino properties that are enabled by the precise and robust
	constraint on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum at low redshift
	available from our data. In combination with cluster gas mass fraction,
	cosmic microwave background, supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation
	data, and incorporating conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties,
	we limit the species-summed neutrino mass, Mnu, to < 0.33 eV at 95.4
	per cent confidence in a spatially flat, cosmological constant (LambdaCDM)
	model. In a flat LambdaCDM model where the effective number of neutrino
	species, Neff, is allowed to vary, we find Neff = 3.4+0.6-0.5 (68.3
	per cent confidence, incorporating a direct constraint on the Hubble
	parameter from Cepheid and supernova data). We also obtain results
	with additional degrees of freedom in the cosmological model, in
	the form of global spatial curvature (Omegak) and a primordial spectrum
	of tensor perturbations (r and nt). The results are not immune to
	these generalizations; however, in the most general case we consider,
	in which Mnu, Neff, curvature and tensors are all free, we still
	obtain Mnu < 0.70 eV and Neff = 3.7 +/- 0.7 (at, respectively, the
	same confidence levels as above). These results agree well with recent
	work using independent data and highlight the importance of measuring
	cosmic structure and expansion at low as well as high (z ~ 1100)
	redshifts. Although our cluster data extend to redshift z = 0.5,
	the direct effect of neutrino mass on the growth of structure at
	late times is not yet detected at a significant level.},

	Abstract = {Renormalization group (RG) techniques have been successfully employed
	in quantum field theory and statistical physics. Here we apply RG
	methods to study the non-linear stages of structure formation in
	the universe. Exact equations for the power spectrum, the bispectrum,
	and all higher order correlation functions can be derived for any
	underlying cosmological model. A remarkable feature of the RG flow
	is the emergence of an intrinsic UV cut-off, due to dark matter velocity
	dispersion, which improves the convergence of the equations at small
	scales. As a consequence, the method is able to follow the non-linear
	evolution of the power spectrum down to zero redshift and to length
	scales where perturbation theory fails. Our predictions accurately
	fit the results of N-body simulations in reproducing the 'baryon
	acoustic oscillation' features of the power spectrum, which will
	be accurately measured in future galaxy surveys and will provide
	a probe for distinguishing among different dark energy models.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new approach to study the nonlinear evolution in the
	large-scale structure of the Universe both in real space and in redshift
	space, extending the standard perturbation theory of gravitational
	instability. Infinite series of terms in standard Eulerian perturbation
	theory are resummed as a result of our starting from a Lagrangian
	description of perturbations. Delicate nonlinear effects on scales
	of the baryon acoustic oscillations are more accurately described
	by our method than the standard one. Our approach differs from other
	resummation techniques recently proposed, such as the renormalized
	perturbation theory, etc., in that we use simple techniques and thus
	resulting equations are undemanding to evaluate, and in that our
	approach is capable of quantifying the nonlinear effects in redshift
	space. The power spectrum and correlation function of our approach
	are in good agreement with numerical simulations in literature on
	scales of baryon acoustic oscillations. Especially, nonlinear effects
	on the baryon acoustic peak of the correlation function are accurately
	described both in real space and in redshift space. Our approach
	provides a unique opportunity to analytically investigate the nonlinear
	effects on baryon acoustic scales in observable redshift space, which
	is requisite in constraining the nature of dark energy, the curvature
	of the Universe, etc., by redshift surveys.},

	Abstract = {The nonlinear perturbation theory of gravitational instability is
	extended to include effects of both biasing and redshift-space distortions,
	which are inevitable in predicting observable quantities in galaxy
	surveys. Weakly nonlinear effects in galaxy clustering on large scales
	recently attracted great interest, since the precise determination
	of scales of baryon acoustic oscillations is crucial to investigate
	the nature of dark energy by galaxy surveys. We find that a local
	Lagrangian bias and redshift-space distortions are naturally incorporated
	in our formalism of perturbation theory with a resummation technique
	via the Lagrangian picture. Our formalism is applicable to any biasing
	scheme which is local in Lagrangian space, including the halo bias
	as a special case. Weakly nonlinear effects on halo clustering in
	redshift space are analytically given. We assume only a fundamental
	idea of the halo model: haloes form according to the extended Press-Schechter
	theory, and the spatial distributions are locally biased in Lagrangian
	space. There is no need for assuming the spherical collapse model
	to follow the dynamical evolution, which is additionally assumed
	in standard halo prescriptions. One-loop corrections to the power
	spectrum and correlation function of haloes in redshift space are
	explicitly derived and presented. Instead of relying on expensive
	numerical simulations, our approach provides an analytic way of investigating
	the weakly nonlinear effects, simultaneously including the nonlinear
	biasing and nonlinear redshift-space distortions. Nonlinearity introduces
	a weak scale dependence in the halo bias. The scale dependence is
	a smooth function in Fourier space, and the bias does not critically
	change the feature of baryon acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum.
	The same feature in the correlation function is less affected by
	nonlinear effects of biasing.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of
	scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the
	conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others
	in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion
	of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter
	(CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM + HDM models (including a possible
	cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons,
	photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate),
	where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed
	phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular
	care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been
	either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic
	initial conditions on superhorizon scales are derived. The coupled,
	linearized Boltzmann, Einstein, and fluid equations that govern the
	evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved
	numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM
	+ HDM models with neutrino mass densities Omeganu = 0.2 and 0.3,
	assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations.
	We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background
	anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular
	power spectra in the two CDM + HDM models including photon polarization,
	higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The
	numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics.},

@article{mcdonald:2011,
	Abstract = {I show how to reintroduce velocity dispersion into perturbation theory
	(PT) calculations of structure in the Universe, i.e., how to go beyond
	the pressureless fluid approximation, starting from first principles.
	This addresses a possible deficiency in uses of PT to compute clustering
	on the weakly non-linear scales that will be critical for probing
	dark energy. Specifically, I show how to derive a non-negligible
	value for the (initially tiny) velocity dispersion of dark matter
	particles, langledeltanu2rangle , where deltanu is the deviation
	of particle velocities from the local bulk flow. The calculation
	is essentially a renormalization of the homogeneous (zero order)
	dispersion by fluctuations 1st order in the initial power spectrum.
	For power law power spectra with n > -3, the small-scale fluctuations
	diverge and significant dispersion can be generated from an arbitrarily
	small starting value --- the dispersion level is set by an equilibrium
	between fluctuations generating more dispersion and dispersion suppressing
	fluctuations. For an n = -1.4 power law normalized to match the present
	non-linear scale, the dispersion would be ~ 100kms-1. This n corresponds
	roughly to the slope on the non-linear scale in the real LambdaCDM
	Universe, but LambdaCDM contains much less initial small-scale power
	--- not enough to bootstrap the small starting dispersion up to a
	significant value within linear theory (viewed very broadly, structure
	formation has actually taken place rather suddenly and recently,
	in spite of the usual ``hierarchical'' description). The next order
	PT calculation drives the LambdaCDM dispersion up into balance with
	growing structure, and should eventually account for dispersion effects
	seen recently in simulations (I have not yet carried out that calculation).},

	Abstract = {I compute a renormalization group (RG) improvement to the standard
	beyond-linear-order Eulerian perturbation theory (PT) calculation
	of the power spectrum of large-scale density fluctuations in the

	lowest order RGPT appears to be as accurate as one can test using
	existing numerical simulation-calibrated fitting formulas out to
	at least k~=0.3hMpc-1; although inaccuracy is guaranteed at some
	level by approximations in the calculation (which can be improved
	in the future). In contrast, standard PT breaks down virtually as
	soon as beyond-linear corrections become non-negligible, on scales
	even larger than k=0.1hMpc-1. This extension in range of validity
	could substantially enhance the usefulness of PT for interpreting
	baryonic acoustic oscillation surveys aimed at probing dark energy,
	for example. I show that the predicted power spectrum converges at
	high k to a power law with index given by the fixed-point solution
	of the RG equation. I discuss many possible future directions for
	this line of work. The basic calculation of this paper should be

	Abstract = {Local non-Gaussianity causes correlations between large-scale perturbation
	modes and the small-scale power. The large-scale CMB signal has contributions
	from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, which does not correlate
	with the small-scale power. If this ISW contribution can be removed,
	the sensitivity to local non-Gaussianity is improved. Gravitational
	lensing and galaxy counts can be used to trace the ISW contribution;
	in particular, we show that the CMB lensing potential is highly correlated
	with the ISW signal. We construct a nearly optimal estimator for
	the local non-Gaussianity parameter fNL and investigate to what extent
	we can use this to decrease the variance on fNL. We show that the
	variance can be decreased by up to 20% at Planck sensitivity using
	galaxy counts. CMB lensing is a good bias-independent ISW tracer
	for future more sensitive observations, though the fractional decrease
	in variance is small if good polarization data are also available.},

	Abstract = {We study the large-scale anisotropic two-point correlation function
	using 46,760 luminous red galaxies at redshifts 0.16-0.47 from the
	Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure the correlation function as
	a function of separations parallel and perpendicular to the line
	of sight in order to take account of anisotropy of the large-scale
	structure in redshift space. We find a slight signal of baryonic
	features in the anisotropic correlation function, i.e., a ``baryon
	ridge'' corresponding to a baryon acoustic peak in the spherically
	averaged correlation function, which has already been reported using
	the same sample. The baryon ridge has primarily a spherical structure
	with a known radius in comoving coordinates. It enables us to divide
	the redshift distortion effects into dynamical and geometrical components
	and provides further constraints on cosmological parameters, including
	the dark energy equation-of-state. With an assumption of a flat Lambda
	cosmology, we find the best-fit values of Omegam=0.218+0.047-0.037
	and Omegab=0.047+/-0.016 (68% CL) when we use the overall shape of
	the anisotropic correlation function of 40<s<200 h-1 Mpc including
	a scale of baryon acoustic oscillations. When an additional assumption
	of Omegabh2=0.024 is adopted, we obtain OmegaDE=0.770+0.051-0.040
	and w=-0.93+0.45-0.35. These constraints are estimated only from
	our data of the anisotropic correlation function, and they agree
	quite well with values both from the cosmic microwave background
	(CMB) anisotropies and from other complementary statistics using
	the LRG sample. With the CMB prior from the 3 year WMAP results,
	we give stronger constraints on those parameters.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews recent experiments on tritium beta-spectroscopy
	searching for the absolute value of the electron neutrino mass m(nue).
	By the use of dedicated electrostatic filters with high acceptance
	and resolution, the uncertainty on the observable m2(nue) has been
	pushed down to about 3 eV2. The new upper limit of the mass is m(nue)
	< 2 eV at 95% C.L. In view of erroneous and unphysical mass results
	obtained by some earlier experiments in beta decay, particular attention
	is paid to systematic effects. The mass limit is discussed in the
	context of current neutrino research in particle- and astrophysics.
	A preview is given of the next generation of beta-spectroscopy experiments
	currently under development and construction; they aim at lowering
	the m2(nue) uncertainty by another factor of 100, reaching a sensitivity
	limit m(nue) < 0.2 eV.},

	Abstract = {We present a 2.5sigma detection of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
	effect and discuss the constraints it places on cosmological parameters.
	We cross correlate microwave temperature maps from the Wilkinson
	microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP) satellite with a 4000 deg(2 luminous
	red galaxy (LRG) overdensity map measured by the Sloan Digital Sky
	Survey. These galaxies have accurate photometric redshifts (Deltaz{\`A}{\'u}0.03)
	and an approximately volume limited redshift distribution from z{\`A}{\'u}0.2
	to z{\`A}{\'u}0.6 well suited to detecting the ISW effect. Accurate
	photometric redshifts allow us to perform a reliable autocorrelation
	analysis of the LRGs, eliminating the uncertainty in the galaxy bias,
	and combined with the cross correlation signal, constrains cosmological
	parameters---in particular, the matter density. We use a minimum-variance
	power spectrum estimator that optimally weights the data according
	to expected theoretical templates. We find a 2.5sigma signal in the
	Ka, Q, V, and W WMAP bands, after combining the information from
	multipoles 2<=l<400. This is consistent with the expected amplitude
	of the ISW effect but requires a lower matter density than is usually
	assumed: the amplitude, parametrized by the galaxy bias assuming
	OmegaM=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.7, and sigma8=0.9, is bg=4.05$\pm$1.54
	for V band, with similar results for the other bands. This should
	be compared to bg=1.82$\pm$0.02 from the autocorrelation analysis.
	These data provide only a weak confirmation (2.5sigma) of dark energy
	but provide a significant upper limit: OmegaLambda=0.80+0.03-0.06(1sigma)+0.05-0.19(2sigma),
	assuming a cosmology with OmegaM+OmegaLambda=1, Omegab=0.05, sigma8=0.9,
	and w=-1. The weak cross correlation signal rules out low matter
	density/high dark energy density universes and, in combination with
	other data, strongly constrains models with w<-1.3. We provide a
	simple prescription to incorporate these constraints into cosmological
	parameter estimation methods for (OmegaM,sigma8,w). We find no evidence
	for a systematic contamination of ISW signal, either from galactic
	or extragalactic sources, but we do detect some large statistical
	fluctuations on smaller scales that could affect analyses without
	the template weighting.},

	Abstract = {We characterize the nonlinear evolution of the baryon acoustic feature
	as traced by the dark matter and halos, using a combination of perturbation
	theory and N-body simulations. We confirm that the acoustic peak
	traced by the dark matter is both broadened and shifted as structure
	forms, and that this shift is well described by second-order perturbation
	theory. These shifts persist for dark matter halos, and are a simple
	function of halo bias, with the shift (mostly) increasing with increasing
	bias. Extending our perturbation theory results to halos with simple
	two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and Eulerian space)
	quantitatively explains the observed shifts. In particular, we demonstrate
	that there are additional terms that contribute to the shift that
	are absent for the matter. At z=0 for currently favored cosmologies,
	the matter shows shifts of {\`A}{\'u}0.5%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic
	scale by {\`A}{\'u}0.2%, while b=2 halos shift it by {\`A}{\'u}0.5%;
	these shifts decrease by the square of the growth factor D(z) at
	higher redshifts. These results are easily generalized to galaxies
	within the halo model, where we show that simple galaxy models show
	marginally larger shifts than the correspondingly biased halos, due
	to the contribution of satellites in high mass halos. While our focus
	here is on real space, our results make specific predictions for
	redshift space. For currently favored cosmological models, we find
	that the shifts for halos at z=0 increase by {\`A}{\'u}0.3%; at high
	z, they increase by {\`A}{\'u}0.5%D2. Our results demonstrate that
	these theoretical systematics are smaller than the statistical precision
	of upcoming surveys, even if one ignored the corrections discussed
	here. Simple modeling, along the lines discussed here, has the potential
	to reduce these systematics to below the levels of cosmic variance
	limited surveys.},

	Abstract = {The ultrafast photoinduced insulator-metal transition in VO2 is studied
	at different temperatures and excitation fluences using multi-THz
	probe pulses. The spectrally resolved midinfrared response allows
	us to trace separately the dynamics of lattice and electronic degrees

	of the optical pump pulse, which drives the system into a long-lived

	Under all measurement conditions, we observe a modulation of the
	eigenfrequencies of the optical phonon modes induced by their anharmonic
	coupling to the coherent wave-packet motion of V-V dimers at 6.1
	THz. Furthermore, we find a weak quadratic coupling of the electronic
	response to the coherent dimer oscillation resulting in a modulation
	of the electronic conductivity at twice the frequency of the wave-packet
	motion. The findings are discussed in the framework of a qualitative
	model based on an approximation of local photoexcitation of the vanadium

	Abstract = {We describe an attempt to reconstruct the initial conditions for the
	formation of cosmological large-scale structure, under the assumption
	of gravitational instability in a Gaussian density field. Information
	on the power spectrum of the primordial fluctuations is provided
	by a variety of autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses on
	samples of different classes of galaxy and galaxy clusters. These
	results differ from the desired linear power spectrum because of
	three modifying effects: bias, non-linear evolution and redshift-space
	distortions. We show how the latter two effects can be corrected
	for analytically, allowing the linear mass spectrum to be recovered
	provided that the bias is independent of scale for a given class
	of galaxy. We argue that this is a good assumption for large scales,
	which is well verified in practice. We apply this method to eight
	independent data sets, and obtain excellent agreement in the estimated
	linear power spectra for wavelengths lambda >= 10 h^-1^ Mpc, given
	the following conditions. First, the relative bias factors for Abell
	clusters, radio galaxies, optical galaxies and IRAS galaxies must
	be in the ratios b_A_: b_R_: b_0_: b_i_ = 4.5: 1.9: 1.3: 1, to within
	6 per cent rms. Secondly, the data require a significant degree of
	redshift-space distortion: {OMEGA}^0.6^/b_I_ = 1.0 +/- 0.2. Thirdly,
	low values of {OMEGA} and bias are disfavoured because non-linear
	evolution would spoil the agreement in shape between galaxy and cluster
	power spectra. The amplitude of the preferred linear power spectrum
	is only weakly dependent on {OMEGA} and agrees well at large wavelengths
	with the normalization demanded by the COBE data for a scale-invariant
	primordial spectrum, provided that {OMEGA} = 1 and gravity-wave anisotropies
	are negligible. In this case, the shape of the spectrum is extremely
	well described by a CDM transfer function with an apparent value
	of the fitting parameter {OMEGA}h = 0.25. Tilted models, for which
	inflation requires a large gravity-wave contribution to the COBE
	data, predict too little power at 100-Mpc wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using
	Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy
	samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method
	to analyse samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
	and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). BAOs are detected in the
	clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and
	measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.2. BAOs in the clustering
	of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance-redshift relation
	at z = 0.35. The observed scales of the BAOs calculated from these
	samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates
	of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure
	DV(z) ‚{\^a}$\,^{\circ}$ [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3. Here DA is the
	angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This
	gives rs/DV(0.2) = 0.1980 +/- 0.0058 and rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1094 +/-
	0.0033 (1sigma errors), with a correlation coefficient of 0.39, where
	rs is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching
	the BAOs to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives
	DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.812 +/- 0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly
	consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift Supernova Legacy
	Survey (SNLS) supernova data for Lambda cold dark matter cosmologies,
	but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at a
	low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with
	constant w, then we find Omegam = 0.249 +/- 0.018 and w = -1.004
	+/- 0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP
	measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the cosmic
	microwave background.},

	galaxy sample represents the final set of galaxies observed using
	the original SDSS target selection criteria. We analyse the clustering
	of galaxies within this sample, including both the luminous red galaxy
	and main samples, and also include the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift
	Survey data. In total, this sample comprises 893319 galaxies over
	9100deg2. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are observed in power
	spectra measured for different slices in redshift; this allows us
	to constrain the distance-redshift relation at multiple epochs. We
	achieve a distance measure at redshift z = 0.275, of rs(zd)/DV(0.275)
	= 0.1390 +/- 0.0037 (2.7 per cent accuracy), where rs(zd) is the
	comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, DV(z) ‚{\^a}$\,^{\circ}$
	[(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3, DA(z) is the angular diameter distance and
	H(z) is the Hubble parameter. We find an almost independent constraint
	on the ratio of distances DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.736 +/- 0.065, which
	is consistent at the 1.1sigma level with the best-fitting Lambda
	cold dark matter model obtained when combining our z = 0.275 distance
	constraint with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year (WMAP5)
	data. The offset is similar to that found in previous analyses of
	the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is now of lower significance,
	a change caused by a revised error analysis and a change in the methodology
	adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using WMAP5 constraints
	on Omegabh2 and Omegach2, and combining our BAO distance measurements
	with those from the Union supernova sample, places a tight constraint
	on Omegam = 0.286 +/- 0.018 and H0 = 68.2 +/- 2.2kms-1Mpc-1 that
	is robust to allowing Omegak != 0 and w != -1. This result is independent
	of the behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed
	by the BAO and supernova measurements. Combining these data sets
	with the full WMAP5 likelihood constraints provides tight constraints
	on both Omegak = -0.006 +/- 0.008 and w = -0.97 +/- 0.10 for a constant
	dark energy equation of state.},

	Abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega_M, and cosmological-constant
	energy density, Omega_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis
	of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project.
	The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between
	0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the
	Cal{\'a}n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield
	values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes
	are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation.
	The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological
	parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8Omega_M-0.6Omega_Lambda~-0.2+/-0.1
	in the region of interest (Omega_M<~1.5). For a flat (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1)
	cosmology we find Omega^flat_M=0.28^+0.09_-0.08 (1 sigma statistical)
	^+0.05_-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent
	with a Lambda=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe
	model. An open, Lambda=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well:
	the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive,
	with a confidence of P(Lambda>0)=99%, including the identified systematic
	uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble
	time is t^flat_0=14.9^+1.4_-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology.
	The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical
	tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find
	no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution
	or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal{\'a}n/Tololo sample
	and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that
	are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly
	change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not
	a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova
	peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical
	alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

	Abstract = {Non-linear effects are crucial for computing the cosmological matter
	power spectrum to the accuracy required by future generation surveys.
	Here, a new approach is presented, in which the power spectrum, the
	bispectrum and higher order correlations are obtained---at any redshift
	and for any momentum scale---by integrating a system of differential
	equations. The method is similar to that of the familiar BBGKY (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon)
	hierarchy. Truncating at the level of the trispectrum, the solution
	of the equations corresponds to the summation of an infinite class
	of perturbative corrections. Compared to other resummation frameworks,
	the scheme discussed here is particularly suited to cosmologies other
	than LambdaCDM (CDM: cold dark matter), such as those based on modifications
	of gravity and those containing massive neutrinos. As a first application,
	we compute the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature of the power
	spectrum, and compare the results with perturbation theory, the halo
	model, and N-body simulations. The density-velocity and velocity-velocity
	power spectra are also computed, revealing that they are much less
	contaminated by non-linearities than the density-density one. The
	approach can be seen as a particular formulation of the renormalization
	group, in which time is the flow parameter.},

	Abstract = {This chapter aims to present an introduction to current research on
	the nature of the cosmological dark matter and the origin of galaxies
	and large scale structure within the standard theoretical framework:
	gravitational collapse of fluctuations as the origin of structure
	in the expanding universe. General relativistic cosmology is summarized,
	and the data on the basic cosmological parameters ($t_o$ and $H_0
	\equiv 100 h \kmsmpc$, $\Omega_0$, $\Omega_\Lambda$ and $\Omega_b$)
	are reviewed. Various particle physics candidates for hot, warm,
	and cold dark matter are briefly reviewed, together with current
	constraints and experiments that could detect or eliminate them.
	Also included is a very brief summary of the theory of cosmic defects,
	and a somewhat more extended exposition of the idea of cosmological
	inflation with a summary of some current models of inflation. The
	remainder is a discussion of observational constraints on cosmological
	model building, emphasizing models in which most of the dark matter
	is cold and the primordial fluctuations are the sort predicted by
	inflation. It is argued that the simplest models that have a hope
	of working are Cold Dark Matter with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM)
	if the Hubble parameter is high ($h \gsim 0.7$), and Cold + Hot Dark
	Matter (CHDM) if the Hubble parameter and age permit an $\Omega=1$
	cosmology, as seems plausible in light of the data from the Hipparcos
	astrometric satellite. The most attractive variants of these models
	and the critical tests for each are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We study the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion by orbit
	crossing using cosmological numerical simulations, and calculate
	the backreaction of these effects on the evolution of large-scale
	density and velocity divergence power spectra. We use Delaunay tessellations
	to define the velocity field, showing that the power spectra of velocity
	divergence and vorticity measured in this way are unbiased and have
	better noise properties than for standard interpolation methods that
	deal with mass-weighted velocities. We show that high resolution
	simulations are required to recover the correct large-scale vorticity
	power spectrum, while poor resolution can spuriously amplify its
	amplitude by more than 1 order of magnitude. We measure the scalar
	and vector modes of the stress tensor induced by orbit crossing using
	an adaptive technique, showing that its vector modes lead, when input
	into the vorticity evolution equation, to the same vorticity power
	spectrum obtained from the Delaunay method. We incorporate orbit-crossing
	corrections to the evolution of large-scale density and velocity
	fields in perturbation theory by using the measured stress tensor
	modes. We find that at large scales (k~=0.1hMpc-1) vector modes have
	very little effect in the density power spectrum, while scalar modes
	(velocity dispersion) can induce percent-level corrections at z=0,
	particularly in the velocity divergence power spectrum. In addition,
	we show that the velocity power spectrum is smaller than predicted
	by linear theory until well into the nonlinear regime, with little
	contribution from virial velocities.},

	Abstract = {We perform a cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave background
	using the third year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
	data with the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy map (about
	828000 galaxies with median redshift z ~ 0.07). One motivation is
	to detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, expected if the
	cosmic gravitational potential is time dependent; for example, as
	it is in a flat universe with a dark energy component. The measured
	spherical harmonic cross-correlation signal favours the ISW signal
	expected in the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model
	over that of zero correlation, although both are consistent with
	the data within 2sigma. Within a flat LambdaCDM model we find a best-fitting
	value of OmegaLambda = 0.85 and OmegaLambda < 0.89 (95 per cent CL).
	The above limits assume a galaxy bias bg(sigma8/0.75) ~ 1.40 +/-
	0.03, which we derived directly from the 2MASS autocorrelation. Another
	goal is to test if previously reported anomalies in the WMAP data
	are related to the galaxy distribution (the so-called `axis of evil'
	- AoE). No such anomaly is observed in the 2MASS data nor are there
	any observed AoE correlations between the 2MASS and WMAP3 data.},

	Abstract = {After adjustment for observational parameters, various models predict
	an upper anisotropy limit of microwave background radiation of delta
	T/T less than 0.00017 at the 95 percent confidence level for uncorrelated
	patches of sky that are uniform on a 2-arcsec scale. This limit is
	more than a factor of 2 lower than previous limits on comparable

	useful constraints on models of galaxy formation based on adiabatic
	or isocurvature fluctuations in baryonic matter, provided that any
	reionization of the intergalactic medium occurred at z less than
	40. Adiabatic models are ruled out with greater than 95 percent confidence,
	and isocurvature models with Omega less than 0.8 are inconsistent
	with the measured limits. Nonbaryonic models with early reionization
	predict anisotropy levels up to a factor of 3 below the present limit.
	The lowest predictions come from models with biased galaxy formation,
	nonbaryonic matter, and early reionization and are as much as a factor
	of 10 below the present sensitivity limit. The predictions of most

@article{reid:2010,
	Abstract = {We illustrate how recently improved low-redshift cosmological measurements
	can tighten constraints on neutrino properties. In particular we
	examine the impact of the assumed cosmological model on the constraints.
	We first consider the new HST H0 = 74.2$\pm$3.6 measurement by Riess
	et al. (2009) and the sigma8(Omegam/0.25)0.41 = 0.832$\pm$0.033 constraint
	from Rozo et al. (2009) derived from the SDSS maxBCG Cluster Catalog.
	In a LambdaCDM model and when combined with WMAP5 constraints, these
	low-redshift measurements constrain ‚{\`a}{\"e}mnu < 0.4 eV at the
	95% confidence level. This bound does not relax when allowing for
	the running of the spectral index or for primordial tensor perturbations.
	When adding also Supernovae and BAO constraints, we obtain a 95%
	upper limit of ‚{\`a}{\"e}mnu < 0.3eV. We test the sensitivity of
	the neutrino mass constraint to the assumed expansion history by
	both allowing a dark energy equation of state parameter w!=-1 and
	by studying a model with coupling between dark energy and dark matter,
	which allows for variation in w, Omegak, and dark coupling strength
	xi. When combining CMB, H0 and the SDSS LRG halo power spectrum from
	Reid et al. 2009, we find that in this very general model, ‚{\`a}{\"e}mnu
	< 0.51 eV with 95% confidence. If we allow the number of relativistic
	species Nrel to vary in a LambdaCDM model with ‚{\`a}{\"e}mnu = 0,
	we find Nrel = 3.76+0.63-0.68(+1.38-1.21) for the 68% and 95% confidence
	intervals. We also report prior-independent constraints, which are
	in excellent agreement with the Bayesian constraints.},

	Abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae
	(SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 <= z <= 0.62. The luminosity
	distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ
	relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined
	with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent
	results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae
	and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on
	the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0),
	the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the
	vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter
	(q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances
	of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than
	expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a
	cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN
	Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally
	expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda
	> 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0).
	With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M >= 0,
	the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent
	with q_0 < 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and
	with Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels,
	for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal''
	mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda
	> 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods.
	For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically
	confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda > 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma
	formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods.
	A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally
	ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two
	different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe
	to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the
	current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of
	several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity
	evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations
	in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination.
	Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with
	Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 >= 0.},

	Abstract = {We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light-curve shapes
	(MLCSs) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight
	extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The empirical correlation
	between the MLCSs and the luminosity is derived from a "training
	set" of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening
	estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia's are redder and
	have faster light curves than the bright ones, which are slow and
	blue. By 35 days after maximum, the intrinsic color variations become
	negligible. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes's theorem
	is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying
	the MLCS method to both light curves and to color curves provides
	enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because
	they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim
	because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances

	Abstract = {We analyse the density field of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital
	Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
	included in the SDSS Data Release Nine (DR9). DR9 includes spectroscopic
	redshifts for over 400 000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3275
	deg2. We identify, characterize and mitigate the impact of sources
	of systematic uncertainty on large-scale clustering measurements,
	both for angular moments of the redshift-space correlation function,
	xil(s), and the spherically averaged power spectrum, P(k), in order
	to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be obtained from
	these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars
	and the higher redshift (0.43 < z < 0.7) galaxy sample (the approximately
	constant stellar mass threshold 'CMASS' sample) due to imaging systematics
	imparts a systematic error that is larger than the statistical error
	of the clustering measurements at scales s > 120 h-1 Mpc or k < 0.01
	h Mpc-1. We find that these errors can be ameliorated by weighting
	galaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar
	density. The clustering of CMASS galaxies found in the Northern and
	Southern Galactic footprints of the survey generally agrees to within
	2sigma. We use mock galaxy catalogues that simulate the CMASS selection
	function to determine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in
	order to simulate the radial selection function of a random sample
	imparts the least systematic error on xil(s) measurements and that
	this systematic error is negligible for the spherically averaged
	correlation function, xi0. We find a peak in xi0 at s{\`A}{\'u} 200
	h-1 Mpc, with a corresponding feature with period {\`A}{\'u}0.03
	h Mpc-1 in P(k), and find features at least as strong in 4.8 per
	cent of the mock galaxy catalogues, concluding this feature is likely
	to be a consequence of cosmic variance. The methods we recommend
	for the calculation of clustering measurements using the CMASS sample
	are adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon
	acoustic oscillation feature, constrain cosmological models using
	the full shape of xi0 and measure the rate of structure growth.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the calibration of BVRIH-0.5 Tully-Fisher relations
	based on Cepheid distances to 21 galaxies within 25 Mpc and 23 clusters
	within 10,000 km s-1. These relations have been applied to several
	distant cluster surveys in order to derive a value for the Hubble
	constant, H0, mainly concentrating on an I-band all-sky survey by
	Giovanelli and collaborators, consisting of total I magnitudes and
	50% line width data for ~550 galaxies in 16 clusters. For comparison,
	we also derive the values of H0 using surveys in the B and V bands
	by Bothun and collaborators, and in H band by Aaronson and collaborators.
	Careful comparisons with various other databases from the literature
	suggest that the H-band data, which have isophotal magnitudes extrapolated
	from aperture magnitudes rather than total magnitudes, are subject
	to systematic uncertainties. Taking a weighted average of the estimates
	of Hubble constants from four surveys, we obtain H0=71+/-4 (random)+/-7
	(systematic). We have also investigated how the value of H0 is affected
	by various systematic uncertainties, such as the internal extinction
	correction method used, Tully-Fisher slopes and shapes, a possible
	metallicity dependence of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation,
	and cluster population incompleteness bias.},

	Abstract = {On large angular scales (‚{\^a}≥60$\,^{\circ}$), the two-point angular
	correlation function of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
	(CMB), as measured (outside of the plane of the Galaxy) by the Wilkinson
	Microwave Anisotropy Probe, shows significantly lower large-angle
	correlations than expected from the standard inflationary cosmological
	model. Furthermore, when derived from the full CMB sky, the two lowest
	cosmologically interesting multipoles, the quadrupole (l = 2) and
	the octopole (l = 3), are unexpectedly aligned with each other. Using
	randomly generated full-sky and cut-sky maps, we investigate whether
	these anomalies are correlated at a statistically significant level.
	We conclusively demonstrate that, assuming Gaussian random and statistically
	isotropic CMB anisotropies, there is no statistically significant
	correlation between the missing power on large angular scales in
	the CMB and the alignment of the l = 2 and l = 3 multipoles. The
	chance to measure the sky with both such a lack of large-angle correlation
	and such an alignment of the low multipoles is thus quantified to
	be below 10-6.},

	Abstract = {Understanding a behavior of galaxy biasing is crucial for future galaxy
	redshift surveys. One aim is to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations
	(BAOs) within the precision of a few percent level. Using 30 large
	cosmological N-body simulations for a standard LambdaCDM cosmology,
	we study the halo biasing over a wide redshift range. We compare
	the simulation results with theoretical predictions proposed by Matsubara
	[T. Matsubara, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ1550-7998 78, 083519 (2008).10.1103/PhysRevD.78.083519]
	which naturally incorporate the halo bias and redshift-space distortions
	into their formalism of perturbation theory with a resummation technique
	via the Lagrangian picture. The power spectrum and correlation function
	of halos obtained from Lagrangian resummation theory (LRT) well agree
	with N-body simulation results on scales of BAOs. Especially nonlinear
	effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the halo correlation function
	are accurately explained both in real and redshift space. We find
	that nonlinearity and scale dependence of bias are fairly well reproduced
	by 1-loop LRT up to k=0.35hMpc-1 (z=2 and 3) within a few percent
	level in real space and up to k=0.1hMpc-1 (z=2) and 0.15hMpc-1 (z=3)
	in redshift space. Thus, the LRT is very powerful for accurately
	extracting cosmological information in upcoming high redshift BAO
	surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present the cross-correlation of the density map of luminous red
	galaxies (LRGs) and the temperature fluctuation in the cosmic microwave
	background (CMB) as measured by the five-year Wilkinson Microwave
	Anisotropy Probe observations. The LRG samples were extracted from
	imaging data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release
	5 based on two previous spectroscopic redshift surveys, the SDSS
	LRG and the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) surveys designed to have
	average redshifts of z ~ 0.35 and z ~ 0.55. In addition, we have
	added a higher redshift photometric LRG sample based on the selection
	of the AAOmega LRG redshift survey at z ~ 0.7. The total LRG sample
	thus comprises 1.5 million galaxies, sampling a redshift range of
	0.2 < z < 0.9 over ~7600 deg2 of the sky, probing a total cosmic
	volume of ~5.5h-3Gpc3. First, we find that the new LRG sample at
	z ~ 0.7 shows very little positive evidence for the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe
	(ISW) effect. Indeed, the cross-correlation is negative out to ~1$\,^{\circ}$.
	The standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model is rejected
	at ~2-3 per cent significance by the new LRG data. We then analyse
	the previous samples at z ~ 0.35 and z ~ 0.55. As found by other
	authors, these results appear consistent with the standard ISW model,
	although the statistical significance remains marginal. We also reproduce
	the same result for the magnitude-limited SDSS galaxy samples of
	Giannantonio et al. Taking the z ~ 0.35 and z ~ 0.55 LRG results
	in combination with the new z ~ 0.7 sample, the overall result is
	now more consistent with a null detection than with the standard
	LambdaCDM model prediction. We then performed a new test on the robustness
	of the LRG ISW detections at z ~ 0.35 and z ~ 0.55. We made eight
	rotations through 360$\,^{\circ}$ of the CMB maps with respect to
	the LRG samples around the galactic pole. We find that in both cases,
	there are stronger effects at angles other than zero. This implies
	that the z ~ 0.35 and z ~ 0.55 ISW detections may still be subject
	to systematic errors which combined with the known sizeable statistical
	errors may leave the z ~ 0.35 and z ~ 0.55 ISW detections looking
	unreliable. We have further made the rotation test on several other
	samples where ISW detections have been claimed and find that they
	also show peaks when rotated. We conclude that in the samples we
	have tested, the ISW effect may be absent and we argue that this
	result may not be in contradiction with previous results.},

	Abstract = {The braneworld model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) provides
	an intriguing modification of gravity at large distances and late
	times. By embedding a three-brane in an uncompactified extra dimension
	with separate Einstein-Hilbert terms for both brane and bulk, the
	DGP model allows for an accelerating universe at late times even
	in the absence of an explicit vacuum energy. We examine the evolution
	of cosmological perturbations on large scales in this theory. At
	late times, perturbations enter a DGP regime in which the effective
	value of Newton's constant increases as the background density diminishes.
	This leads to a suppression of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect,
	bringing DGP gravity into slightly better agreement with WMAP data
	than conventional LCDM. However, we find that this is not enough
	to compensate for the significantly worse fit to supernova data and
	the distance to the last-scattering surface in the pure DGP model.
	LCDM is, therefore, a better fit.},

	Abstract = {BigBOSS is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment to study
	baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure with
	a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey over 14,000 square
	degrees. It has been conditionally accepted by NOAO in response to
	a call for major new instrumentation and a high-impact science program
	for the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument
	is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking
	5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 340 nm to
	1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800. Using data from imaging
	surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic targets are selected
	that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. In particular,
	targets include luminous red galaxies (LRGs) up to z = 1.0, extending
	the BOSS LRG survey in both redshift and survey area. To probe the
	universe out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright
	[OII] emission line galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million
	galaxy redshifts are obtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the
	matter power spectrum at smaller scales, and detect redshift space
	distortions. BigBOSS will provide additional constraints on early
	dark energy and on the curvature of the universe by measuring the
	Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 < z < 3.5 quasars.
	BigBOSS galaxy BAO measurements combined with an analysis of the
	broadband power, including the Ly-alpha forest in BigBOSS quasar
	spectra, achieves a FOM of 395 with Planck plus Stage III priors.
	This FOM is based on conservative assumptions for the analysis of
	broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could grow to over 600 if current
	work allows us to push the analysis to higher wave numbers (kmax
	= 0.3). BigBOSS will also place constraints on theories of modified
	gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses
	to 0.024 eV accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Bekenstein's alternative to general relativity, TeVeS, reduces to
	modified Newtonian dynamics in the galactic limit. On cosmological
	scales, the (potentialwell<-->overdensity) relationship is quite
	different than in standard general relativity. Here we investigate
	the possibility of cross-correlating galaxies with the cosmic microwave
	background (CMB) to probe this relationship. At redshifts of order
	2, the sign of the CMB-galaxy correlation differs in TeVeS from that
	in general relativity. We show that this effect is detectable and
	hence can serve as a powerful discriminator of these two models of
	gravity.},

	Abstract = {The last parameter of big-bang nucleosynthesis, the density of ordinary
	matter (baryons), is being pinned down by measurements of the deuterium
	abundance in high-redshift hydrogen clouds. When it is, the primeval
	abundances of the light elements D, 3He, 7Li, and 4He will be fixed.
	The first three will then become ``tracers'' in the study of Galactic
	and stellar chemical evolution. A precision determination of the
	4He abundance will allow an important consistency test of big-bang
	nucleosynthesis and will sharpen nucleosynthesis as a probe of fundamental
	physics, e.g., the bound to the number of light neutrino species.
	An independent consistency test is on the horizon: a high-precision
	determination of the baryon density from measurements of the fluctuations
	of the cosmic background radiation temperature.},

	Abstract = {The standard procedure to generate initial conditions in numerical
	simulations of structure formations is to use the Zel'dovich approximation
	(ZA). Although the ZA correctly reproduces the linear growing modes
	of density and velocity perturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately
	represented, particularly for velocity perturbations because of the
	ZA failure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time
	for the actual dynamics to establish the correct statistical properties
	of density and velocity fields. We extend the standard formulation
	of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as non-linear
	excitations of decaying modes caused by the initial conditions. These
	new non-linear solutions interpolate between the initial conditions
	and the late-time solutions given by the exact non-linear dynamics.
	To quantify the magnitude of transients, we focus on higher order
	statistics of the density contrast delta and velocity divergence
	Theta, characterized by the S_p and T_p parameters. These describe
	the non-Gaussianity of the probability distribution through its connected
	moments <delta^p>_c=S_p<delta^2>^p-1,<Theta^p>_c=T_p<Theta^2>^p-1.
	We calculate S_p(a) and T_p(a) to leading order in PT with top-hat
	smoothing as a function of the scale factor a. We find that the time-scale
	of transients is determined, at a given order p, by the effective
	spectral index n_eff. The skewness factor S_3(T_3) attains 10 per
	cent accuracy only after a~6(a~15) for n_eff~0, whereas higher (lower)
	n_eff demands more (less) expansion away from the initial conditions.
	These requirements become much more stringent as p increases, always
	showing slower decay of transients for T_p than S_p. For models with
	density parameter Omega!=1, the conditions above apply to the linear
	growth factor; thus an Omega=0.3 open model requires roughly a factor
	of 2 larger expansion than a critical density model to reduce transients
	by the same amount. The predicted transients in S_p are in good agreement
	with numerical simulations. More accurate initial conditions can
	be achieved by using second-order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces
	growing modes up to second order and thus eliminates transients in
	the skewness parameters. We show that for p>3 this scheme can reduce
	the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared
	to the ZA. Setting up 2LPT initial conditions requires only minimal,
	inexpensive changes to ZA codes. We suggest simple steps for its
	implementation.},

	Abstract = {The bispectrum B(k1, k2, k3), the three-point function of density
	fluctuations in Fourier space, is the lowest order statistic that
	carries information about the spatial coherence of large-scale structures.
	For Gaussian initial conditions, when the density fluctuation amplitude
	is small ( delta << 1), tree-level (leading order) perturbation theory
	predicts a characteristic dependence of the bispectrum on the shape
	of the triangle formed by the three wave vectors. This configuration
	dependence provides a signature of gravitational instability, and
	departures from it in galaxy catalogs can be interpreted as due to
	bias, that is, nongravitational effects. On the other hand, N-body
	simulations indicate that the reduced three-point function becomes
	relatively shape-independent in the strongly nonlinear regime ( delta
	>> 1). In order to understand this nonlinear transition and assess
	the domain of reliability of shape dependence as a probe of bias,
	we calculate the one-loop (next-to-leading order) corrections to
	the bispectrum in perturbation theory. We compare these results with
	measurements in numerical simulations with scale-free and cold dark
	matter initial power spectra. We find that the one-loop corrections
	account very well for the departures from the tree-level results
	measured in numerical simulations on weakly nonlinear scales ( delta
	<~ 1). In this regime, the reduced bispectrum qualitatively retains
	its tree-level shape, but the amplitude can change significantly.
	At smaller scales ( delta >~ 1), the reduced bispectrum in the simulations
	starts to flatten, an effect that can be partially understood from
	the one-loop results. In the strong clustering regime, where perturbation
	theory breaks down entirely, the simulation results confirm that
	the reduced bispectrum has almost no dependence on triangle shape,
	in rough agreement with the hierarchical Ansatz.},

	Abstract = {We derive the expressions for the one-loop corrections in cosmological,
	Eulerian, perturbation theory to the matter bispectrum and to the
	galaxy bispectrum, assuming local galaxy bias, in the presence of
	non-Gaussian initial conditions. We compute them explicitly for the
	particular case of nonvanishing initial bispectrum and trispectrum
	in the local model and for a nonvanishing initial bispectrum alone
	for the equilateral model of primordial non-Gaussianity. While the
	primordial contribution to the matter bispectrum for values compatible

	component due to gravitational instability at large scales, one-loop
	perturbative corrections due to non-Gaussian initial conditions correspond
	to just a few percent of the gravity-induced bispectrum at mildly
	nonlinear scales, similar to what happens for the matter power spectrum.
	However, in the perturbative expansion for the galaxy bispectrum,
	one-loop diagrams arising from nonlinear bias are responsible for
	significant large-scale contributions, indeed exceeding the primordial
	component, both for the local and equilateral model. We study the

	Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and high resolution spectra with cosmic
	microwave background (CMB) including three-year WMAP, and supernovae
	(SN) and galaxy clustering constraints to derive new constraints
	on cosmological parameters. The existing LYA power spectrum analysis
	is supplemented by constraints on the mean flux decrement derived
	using a principle component analysis for quasar continua, which improves
	the LYA constraints on the linear power. We find some tension between
	the WMAP3 and LYA power spectrum amplitudes, at the ~2sigma level,
	which is partially alleviated by the inclusion of other observations:
	we find sigma8 = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.02 compared to sigma8 = 0.80 $\pm$
	0.03 without LYA. For the slope, we find ns = 0.965 $\pm$ 0.012.
	We find no evidence for the running of the spectral index in the
	combined analysis, dn/dlnk = -(1.5 $\pm$ 1.2) √{\'o} 10-2, in agreement
	with inflation. The limits on the sum of neutrino masses are significantly
	improved: {\sum } m_{\nu }\lt 0.17~\mathrm {eV} at 95% (<0.32 eV
	at 99.9%). This result, when combined with atmospheric and solar
	neutrino mixing constraints, requires that the neutrino masses cannot
	be degenerate, m3/m1>1.3 (95% c.l.). Assuming a thermalized fourth
	neutrino, we find ms<0.26 eV at 95% c.l. and such a neutrino cannot
	be an explanation for the LSND results. In the limits of massless
	neutrinos, we obtain the effective number of neutrinos Nnueff = 5.3-0.6+0.4-1.7+2.1-2.5+3.8
	and Nnueff = 3.04 is allowed only at 2.4 sigma. The constraint on

	Abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background
	(CM B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along
	the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy
	is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term
	and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions,
	which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source
	term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations,
	all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential
	equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical
	effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to
	significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard
	methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends
	on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation,
	is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated
	only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates
	much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular
	model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do
	not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations.
	The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in
	CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires
	a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should
	be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological
	parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that
	will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing
	this method can be obtained from the authors.},

	Abstract = {We measure shifts of the acoustic scale due to nonlinear growth and
	redshift distortions to a high precision using a very large volume
	of high-force-resolution simulations. We compare results from various
	sets of simulations that differ in their force, volume, and mass
	resolution. We find a consistency within 1.5sigma for shift values
	from different simulations and derive shift alpha(z) - 1 = (0.300
	$\pm$ 0.015) %[D(z)/D(0)]2 using our fiducial set. We find a strong
	correlation with a non-unity slope between shifts in real space and
	in redshift space and a weak correlation between the initial redshift
	and low redshift. Density-field reconstruction not only removes the
	mean shifts and reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens the
	correlations. After reconstruction, we recover a slope of near unity
	for the correlation between the real and redshift space and restore
	a strong correlation between the initial and the low redshifts. We
	derive propagators and mode-coupling terms from our N-body simulations
	and compare with the Zel'dovich approximation and the shifts measured
	from the chi2 fitting, respectively. We interpret the propagator
	and the mode-coupling term of a nonlinear density field in the context
	of an average and a dispersion of its complex Fourier coefficients
	relative to those of the linear density field; from these two terms,
	we derive a signal-to-noise ratio of the acoustic peak measurement.
	We attempt to improve our reconstruction method by implementing 2LPT
	and iterative operations, but we obtain little improvement. The Fisher
	matrix estimates of uncertainty in the acoustic scale is tested using
	5000 h -3 Gpc3 of cosmological Particle-Mesh simulations from Takahashi
	et al. At an expected sample variance level of 1%, the agreement
	between the Fisher matrix estimates based on Seo and Eisenstein and
	the N-body results is better than 10%.},

	Abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of the acoustic

	using 320 h-3 Gpc3 of cosmological particle-mesh simulations. Using
	simple fitting methods, we obtain robust measurements of the acoustic
	scale with scatter close to that predicted by the Fisher matrix.
	We detect and quantify the shift in the acoustic scale by analyzing
	the power spectrum: we detect at greater than 5 sigma a decrease
	in the acoustic scale in the real-space matter power spectrum of
	0.2% at z=1.5, growing to 0.45% at z=0.3. In redshift space, the
	shifts are about 25% larger: we detect a decrease of 0.25% at z=1.5
	and 0.54% at z=0.3. Despite the nonzero amounts, these shifts are
	highly predictable numerically, and hence removable within the standard
	ruler analysis of clustering data. Moreover, we show that a simple
	density field reconstruction method substantially reduces the scatter
	and nonlinear shifts of the acoustic scale measurements: the shifts
	are reduced to less than 0.1% at z=0.3-1.5, even in the presence
	of nonnegligible shot noise. Finally, we show that the ratio of the

@article{spergel:2003,
	Abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models.
	We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated
	universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations,
	fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters
	are h=0.72+/-0.05, Omegabh2=0.024+/-0.001, Omegamh2=0.14+/-0.02,
	tau=0.166+0.076-0.071, ns=0.99+/-0.04, and sigma8=0.9+/-0.1. With
	parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic
	microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale
	structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyalpha forest). This simple model
	is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements:
	its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages,
	the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H]
	ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local
	observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters
	to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments
	(ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Lyalpha forest data to
	find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03,
	Omegabh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, Omegamh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+/-0.06,
	ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and sigma8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination
	of tau=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization
	(TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These
	parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr.
	With the Lyalpha forest data, the model favors but does not require
	a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running
	index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Lyalpha forest. By
	combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the
	geometry of the universe, Omegatot=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation
	of state of the dark energy, w<-0.78 (95% confidence limit assuming
	w>=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy
	density in stable neutrinos: Omeganuh2<0.0072 (95% confidence limit).
	For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their
	mass is less than 0.23 eV (95% confidence limit). The WMAP detection
	of early reionization rules out warm dark matter. WMAP is the result
	of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard
	Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP
	Science Team.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively
	parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid
	with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle
	hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves
	energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing
	for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed
	with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be
	applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range
	forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces
	are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based
	on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces
	can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive
	short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition
	used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling
	curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do
	not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient
	in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth.
	It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation
	with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous
	spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional
	box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH
	simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation,
	reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present
	the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance
	using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to

	Abstract = {We investigate the relation between the regularized multi-propagator
	method, called "Reg PT", and the standard perturbation theory. Reg
	PT is one of the most successful models to describe nonlinear evolution
	of dark matter fluctuations. However, Reg PT is a mathematically
	unproved interpolation formula between the large-scale solution calculated
	by the standard perturbation theory and the limiting solution in
	the small scale calculated by the multi-point propagator method.
	In this paper, we give a proof of Reg PT in the context of the standard
	perturbation theory, showing that Reg PT never has more effective
	information on the nonlinear matter evolution than the standard perturbation
	theory. In other words, the solutions of the standard perturbation
	theory reproduce the results of $N$-body simulations better than
	the ones of Reg PT. Moreover, the 2-loop solutions in the standard
	perturbation theory are also better than the ones of the closure
	theory. This fact means that the standard perturbation theory at
	the 2-loop level gives the best prediction of nonlinear power spectrum
	at present. Nevertheless, the standard perturbation theory has not
	been preferred because of the divergent behavior of the solution
	at small scales. To solve this problem, we also propose a modified
	standard perturbation theory which avoids the divergence.},

	Abstract = {If Dark Energy introduces an acceleration in the universal expansion
	then large scale gravitational potential wells should be shrinking,
	causing a blueshift in the CMB photons that cross such structures
	(Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, [ISW]). Galaxy clusters are known
	to probe those potential wells. In these objects, CMB photons also
	experience inverse Compton scattering off the hot electrons of the
	intra-cluster medium, and this results in a distortion with a characteristic
	spectral signature of the CMB spectrum (the so-called thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
	effect, [tSZ]). Since both the ISW and the tSZ effects take place
	in the same potential wells, they must be spatially correlated. We
	present how this cross ISW-tSZ signal can be detected in a CMB-data
	contained way by using the frequency dependence of the tSZ effect
	in multi frequency CMB experiments like {\it Planck}, {\em without}
	requiring the use of external large scale structure tracers data.
	We find that by masking low redshift clusters, the shot noise level
	decreases significantly, boosting the signal to noise ratio of the
	ISW--tSZ cross correlation. We also find that galactic and extragalactic
	dust residuals must be kept at or below the level of ~0.04 muK^2
	at l=10, a limit that is a factor of a few below {\it Planck}'s expectations
	for foreground subtraction. If this is achieved, CMB observations
	of the ISW-tSZ cross correlation should also provide an independent
	probe for the existence of Dark Energy and the amplitude of density
	perturbations.},

	Abstract = {We provide a simple, unified approach to describing the impact of
	super-sample covariance on power spectrum estimation in a finite-volume
	survey. For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that
	arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance
	of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey.
	The perturbative and deeply nonlinear versions of this effect are
	known as beat coupling and halo sample variance respectively. We
	show that they are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed
	configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation
	which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change
	in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics
	that are based on radial projections of the density field such as
	weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description
	to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables
	an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations.
	It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an
	additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

	Abstract = {We present an improved prescription for the matter power spectrum
	in redshift space taking proper account of both nonlinear gravitational
	clustering and redshift distortion, which are of particular importance
	for accurately modeling baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Contrary
	to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced
	but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the
	corrections arising from the nonlinear coupling between the density
	and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift
	distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the
	improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering,
	we compare our model predictions with the monopole and quadrupole
	power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is
	achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining
	dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum
	are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism, particularly
	focusing on the measurements of the Hubble parameter, angular diameter
	distance, and growth rate for structure formation. We find that the
	existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a
	systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance
	and Hubble parameter by 1%-2% , and the growth-rate parameter by
	{\`A}{\'u}5%, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy
	surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential,
	and the new prescription for the redshift-space power spectrum including
	the nonlinear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical
	template for anisotropic BAOs.},

	Abstract = {We study the nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in
	the matter power spectrum and correlation function from the improved
	perturbation theory (PT). Based on the framework of renormalized
	PT, which provides a nonperturbative way to treat the gravitational
	clustering of large-scale structure, we apply the closure approximation
	that truncates the infinite series of loop contributions at one-loop
	order, and obtain a closed set of integral equations for power spectrum
	and nonlinear propagator. The resultant integral expressions are
	basically equivalent to those previously derived in the form of evolution
	equations, and they keep important nonperturbative properties which
	can dramatically improve the prediction of nonlinear power spectrum.
	Employing the Born approximation, we then derive the analytic expressions
	for nonlinear power spectrum and the predictions are made for nonlinear
	evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in power spectrum and correlation
	function. We find that the improved PT possesses a better convergence
	property compared with standard PT calculation. A detailed comparison
	between improved PT results and N-body simulations shows that a percent-level
	agreement is achieved in a certain range in power spectrum and in
	a rather wider range in correlation function. Combining a model of
	nonlinear redshift-space distortion, we also evaluate the power spectrum
	and correlation function in redshift space. In contrast to the results
	in real space, the agreement between N-body simulations and improved
	PT predictions tends to be worse, and a more elaborate modeling for
	redshift-space distortion needs to be developed. Nevertheless, with
	the currently existing model, we find that the prediction of correlation
	function has a sufficient accuracy compared with the cosmic-variance
	errors for future galaxy surveys with volume of a few h-3Gpc3 at
	z‚{\^a}≥0.5.},

	Abstract = {We measure the large-scale real-space power spectrum P(k) using luminous
	red galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and use
	this measurement to sharpen constraints on cosmological parameters
	from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We employ a
	matrix-based power spectrum estimation method using Pseudo-Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve
	eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated minimum-variance measurements
	in 20 k-bands of both the clustering power and its anisotropy due
	to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved window
	functions in the range 0.01h/Mpc<k<0.2h/Mpc. Results from the LRG
	and main galaxy samples are consistent, with the former providing
	higher signal-to-noise. Our results are robust to omitting angular
	and radial density fluctuations and are consistent between different
	parts of the sky. They provide a striking confirmation of the predicted
	large-scale LambdaCDM power spectrum. Combining only SDSS LRG and
	WMAP data places robust constraints on many cosmological parameters
	that complement prior analyses of multiple data sets. The LRGs provide
	independent cross-checks on Omegam and the baryon fraction in good
	agreement with WMAP. Within the context of flat LambdaCDM models,
	our LRG measurements complement WMAP by sharpening the constraints
	on the matter density, the neutrino density and the tensor amplitude
	by about a factor of 2, giving Omegam=0.24$\pm$0.02 (1sigma), ‚{\`a}{\"e}mnu‚{\^a}≤0.9eV
	(95%) and r<0.3 (95%). Baryon oscillations are clearly detected and
	provide a robust measurement of the comoving distance to the median
	survey redshift z=0.35 independent of curvature and dark energy properties.
	Within the LambdaCDM framework, our power spectrum measurement improves
	the evidence for spatial flatness, sharpening the curvature constraint
	Omegatot=1.05$\pm$0.05 from WMAP alone to Omegatot=1.003$\pm$0.010.
	Assuming Omegatot=1, the equation of state parameter is constrained
	to w=-0.94$\pm$0.09, indicating the potential for more ambitious
	future LRG measurements to provide precision tests of the nature
	of dark energy. All these constraints are essentially independent
	of scales k>0.1h/Mpc and associated nonlinear complications, yet
	agree well with more aggressive published analyses where nonlinear
	modeling is crucial.},

	Abstract = {Precision measurements of the galaxy power spectrum P(k) require a
	data analysis pipeline that is both fast enough to be computationally
	feasible and accurate enough to take full advantage of high-quality
	data. We present a rigorous discussion of different methods of power
	spectrum estimation, with emphasis on the traditional Fourier method
	and linear (Karhunen-Loeve; KL) and quadratic data compression schemes,
	showing in what approximations they give the same result. To improve
	speed, we show how many of the advantages of KL data compression
	and power spectrum estimation may be achieved with a computationally
	faster quadratic method. To improve accuracy, we derive analytic
	expressions for handling the integral constraint, since it is crucial
	that finite volume effects are accurately corrected for on scales
	comparable to the depth of the survey. We also show that for the
	KL and quadratic techniques, multiple constraints can be included
	via simple matrix operations, thereby rendering the results less
	sensitive to Galactic extinction and misestimates of the radial selection
	function. We present a data analysis pipeline that we argue does
	justice to the increases in both quality and quantity of data that
	upcoming redshift surveys will provide. It uses three analysis techniques
	in conjunction: a traditional Fourier approach on small scales, a
	pixelized quadratic matrix method on large scales, and a pixelized
	KL eigenmode analysis to probe anisotropic effects such as redshift-space
	distortions.},

	Abstract = {The application of Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics
	has flourished over the past decade, spurred by data sets of increasing
	size and complexity. In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven
	to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering
	the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual
	basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of
	uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when
	the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare
	them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role
	in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods
	in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I
	first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings,
	Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter
	inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques
	such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory
	and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions
	of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute
	and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological
	parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are
	summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

@article{valageas:2011,
	Abstract = {Aims: We study the effect of nonperturbative corrections associated
	with the behavior of particles after shell crossing on the matter
	power spectrum. We compare their amplitude with the perturbative
	terms that can be obtained within the fluid description of the system,
	to estimate the range of scales where such perturbative approaches
	are relevant. Methods: We use the simple Zeldovich dynamics as a
	benchmark, as it allows the exact computation of the full nonlinear
	power spectrum and of perturbative terms at all orders. Then, we
	introduce a "sticky model" that coincides with the Zeldovich dynamics
	before shell crossing but shows a different behavior afterwards.
	Thus, their power spectra only differ in their nonperturbative terms.
	We consider both the real-space and redshift-space power spectra.
	Results: We find that the potential of perturbative schemes is greater
	at higher redshift for a LambdaCDM cosmology. For the real-space
	power spectrum, one can go up to order 66 of perturbation theory
	at z = 3, and to order 9 at z = 0, before the nonperturbative correction
	surpasses the perturbative correction of that order. This allows
	us to increase the upper bound on k where systematic theoretical
	predictions may be obtained by perturbative schemes, beyond the linear
	regime, by a factor ~26 at z = 3 and ~6.5 at z = 0. This provides
	a strong motivation to study perturbative resummation schemes, especially
	at high redshifts z >= 1. In the context of cosmological reconstruction
	methods, the Monge-Amp{\`e}re-Kantorovich scheme appears to be close
	to optimal at z = 0. There also seems to be little room for improvement
	over current reconstruction methods of the baryon acoustic oscillations
	at z = 0. This can be understood from the small number of perturbative
	terms that are relevant at z = 0, before nonperturbative corrections
	dominate. We also point out that the rise of the power spectrum on
	the transition scale to the nonlinear regime strongly depends on
	the behavior of the system after shell crossing. We find similar
	results for the redshift-space power spectrum, with characteristic
	wavenumbers that are shifted to lower values as redshift-space distortions
	amplify higher order terms of the perturbative expansions while decreasing
	the resummed nonlinear power at high k.},

	Abstract = {We develop a path-integral formalism to study the formation of large-scale
	structures in the universe. Starting from the equations of motion
	of hydrodynamics (single-stream approximation) we derive the action
	which describes the statistical properties of the density and velocity
	fields for Gaussian initial conditions. Then, we present large-N
	expansions (associated with a generalization to N fields or with
	a semi-classical expansion) of the path-integral defined by this
	action. This provides a systematic expansion for two-point functions
	such as the response function and the usual two-point correlation.
	We present the results of two such expansions (and related variants)
	at one-loop order for a SCDM and a LambdaCDM cosmology. We find that
	the response function exhibits fast oscillations in the non-linear
	regime with an amplitude which either follows the linear prediction
	(for the direct steepest-descent scheme) or decays (for the 2PI effective
	action scheme). On the other hand, the correlation function agrees
	with the standard one-loop result in the quasi-linear regime and
	remains well-behaved in the highly non-linear regime. This suggests
	that these large-N expansions could provide a good framework to study
	the dynamics of gravitational clustering in the non-linear regime.
	Moreover, the use of various expansion schemes allows one to estimate
	their range of validity without the need of N-body simulations and
	could provide a better accuracy in the weakly non-linear regime.},

	Abstract = {We show that the formation of large-scale structures through gravitational
	instability in the expanding universe can be fully described through
	a path-integral formalism. We derive the action S[f] which gives
	the statistical weight associated with any phase-space distribution
	function f({x},{p},t). This action S describes both the average over
	the Gaussian initial conditions and the Vlasov-Poisson dynamics.
	Next, applying a standard method borrowed from field theory we generalize
	our problem to an N-field system and we look for an expansion over
	powers of 1/N. We describe three such methods and we derive the corresponding
	equations of motion at the lowest non-trivial order for the case
	of gravitational clustering. This yields a set of non-linear equations
	for the mean /line{f} and the two-point correlation G of the phase-space
	distribution f, as well as for the response function R. These systematic
	schemes match the usual perturbative expansion on quasi-linear scales
	but should also be able to treat the non-linear regime. Our approach
	can also be extended to non-Gaussian initial conditions and may serve
	as a basis for other tools borrowed from field theory. Appendix A

	Abstract = {We report the detection of a significant (5.5 sigma ) excess of correlations
	between galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes.
	This detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure
	was made using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin2
	obtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) with the UH8K
	and CFH12K panoramic CCD cameras. The amplitude of the excess correlation
	is 2.2+/- 0.2% at 1 arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions
	of the lensing effect induced by large-scale structure. We provide
	a quantitative analysis of systematics which could contribute to
	the signal and show that the net effect is small and can be corrected
	for. In particular, we show that the spurious excess of correlations
	caused by the residual of the anisotropic Point Spread Function (PSF)
	correction is well below the measured signal. We show that the measured
	ellipticity correlations behave as expected for a gravitational shear
	signal. The relatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints
	on cosmological models. However the data are in favor of cluster
	normalized cosmological models, and marginally reject Cold Dark Matter
	models with (Omega =0.3, sigma_8 <0.6) or (Omega =1, sigma_8 =1).
	The detection of cosmic shear demonstrates the technical feasibility
	of using weak lensing surveys to measure dark matter clustering and
	the potential for cosmological parameter measurements, in particular
	with upcoming wide field CCD cameras. Based on observations obtained
	at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by
	the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC), the Institut des

	Abstract = {We compute the bispectrum of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS)
	and use it to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. This parameter
	quantifies the strength of clustering of the galaxies relative to
	the mass in the Universe. By analysing 80 √{\'o} 106 triangle configurations
	in the wavenumber range 0.1 < k < 0.5 h Mpc-1 (i.e. on scales roughly
	between 5 and 30 h-1 Mpc) we find that the linear bias parameter
	is consistent with unity: b1= 1.04 +/- 0.11, and the quadratic (non-linear)
	bias is consistent with zero: b2=-0.054 +/- 0.08. Thus, at least
	on large scales, optically selected galaxies do indeed trace the
	underlying mass distribution. The bias parameter can be combined
	with the 2dFGRS measurement of the redshift distortion parameter
	beta~=Omegam0.6/b1, to yield Omegam= 0.27 +/- 0.06 for the matter
	density of the Universe, a result that is determined entirely from
	this survey, independent of other data sets. Our measurement of the
	matter density of the Universe should be interpreted as Omegam at
	the effective redshift of the survey (z= 0.17).},

	Abstract = {We investigate the non-linear evolution of the matter power spectrum
	by using a large set of high-resolution N-body/hydrodynamic simulations.
	The linear matter power in the initial conditions is consistently
	modified to mimic the presence of warm dark matter (WDM) particles
	which induce a small-scale cut-off in the power as compared to standard
	cold dark matter scenarios. The impact of such thermal relics is
	examined at small scales k > 1 h Mpc-1, at redshifts of z < 5, which
	are particularly important for the next generation of Lyman alpha
	forest, weak lensing and galaxy clustering surveys. We measure the
	mass and redshift dependence of the WDM non-linear matter power and
	provide a fitting formula which is accurate at the {\`A}{\'u}2 per
	cent level below z= 3 and for particle masses of mWDM>= 0.5 keV.
	The role of baryonic physics on the WDM-induced suppression is also
	quantified. In particular, we examine the effects of cooling, star
	formation and feedback from strong galactic winds. Finally, we find
	that a modified version of the halo model describes the shape of
	the WDM suppressed power spectra better than HALOFIT. In the case
	of weak lensing however, the latter works better than the former,
	since it is more accurate on the relevant, mid-range scales, albeit
	very inaccurate on the smallest scales (k > 10 h Mpc-1) of the matter
	power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Chandra observations of large samples of galaxy clusters detected
	in X-rays by ROSAT provide a new, robust determination of the cluster
	mass functions at low and high redshifts. Statistical and systematic
	errors are now sufficiently small, and the redshift leverage sufficiently
	large for the mass function evolution to be used as a useful growth
	of a structure-based dark energy probe. In this paper, we present
	cosmological parameter constraints obtained from Chandra observations
	of 37 clusters with langzrang = 0.55 derived from 400 deg2 ROSAT
	serendipitous survey and 49 brightest z ‚{\^a}{\`a} 0.05 clusters
	detected in the All-Sky Survey. Evolution of the mass function between
	these redshifts requires OmegaLambda > 0 with a ~5sigma significance,
	and constrains the dark energy equation-of-state parameter to w 0
	= -1.14 $\pm$ 0.21, assuming a constant w and a flat universe. Cluster
	information also significantly improves constraints when combined
	with other methods. Fitting our cluster data jointly with the latest
	supernovae, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, and baryonic acoustic
	oscillation measurements, we obtain w 0 = -0.991 $\pm$ 0.045 (stat)
	$\pm$0.039 (sys), a factor of 1.5 reduction in statistical uncertainties,
	and nearly a factor of 2 improvement in systematics compared with
	constraints that can be obtained without clusters. The joint analysis
	of these four data sets puts a conservative upper limit on the masses
	of light neutrinos ‚{\`a}{\"e}m nu < 0.33 eV at 95% CL. We also present
	updated measurements of OmegaM h and sigma8 from the low-redshift
	cluster mass function.},

	Abstract = {Most of the matter in the Universe is not luminous, and can be observed
	only through its gravitational influence on the appearance of luminous
	matter. Weak gravitational lensing is a technique that uses the distortions
	of the images of distant galaxies as a tracer of dark matter: such
	distortions are induced as the light passes through large-scale distributions
	of dark matter in the foreground. The patterns of the induced distortions
	reflect the density of mass along the line of sight and its distribution,
	and the resulting `cosmic shear' can be used to distinguish between
	alternative cosmologies. But previous attempts to measure this effect
	have been inconclusive. Here we report the detection of cosmic shear
	on angular scales of up to half a degree using 145,000 galaxies and
	along three separate lines of sight. We find that the dark matter
	is distributed in a manner consistent with either an open universe,
	or a flat universe that is dominated by a cosmological constant.
	Our results are inconsistent with the standard cold-dark-matter model.},

	Abstract = {The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN) aims to determine
	the electron neutrino mass from tritium decay in a model-independent
	way, by a kinematic measurement of the energy of beta-electrons.
	The unprecedented sensitivity of 0.2 eV/c2 will improve present limits
	by one order of magnitude. The decay electrons will originate from
	a 10 m long windowless gaseous tritium source. Super-conducting magnets
	will guide the electrons through a differential and cryogenic pumping
	section to the electro-static tandem spectrometer (MAG-E-filter),
	where the kinetic energy will be measured. The experiment is presently
	being built at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe by an international
	collaboration of more than 120 scientists. The largest component,
	the 1240 m3 main spectrometer, was delivered end of 2006 and first
	commissioning tests have been performed. This paper gives an overview
	of the goals and technological challenges of the experiment and reports
	on the progress in commissioning first major components. The start
	of first measurements is expected in 2012.},

	Starting with the equations of motion for the density and velocity

	kernels similar to those for a cold dark matter only universe, but

	fnu and the linear growth functions of the incoming wavevectors.
	Compared with the fnu = 0 case, the one-loop corrected matter power

	Abstract = {In this paper we rely on the quasar (QSO) catalog of the Sloan Digital
	Sky Survey Data Release Six (SDSS DR6) of about one million photometrically
	selected QSOs to compute the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect
	at high redshift, aiming at constraining the behavior of the expansion
	rate and thus the behaviour of dark energy at those epochs. This
	unique sample significantly extends previous catalogs to higher redshifts
	while retaining high efficiency in the selection algorithm. We compute
	the auto-correlation function (ACF) of QSO number density from which
	we extract the bias and the stellar contamination. We then calculate
	the cross-correlation function (CCF) between QSO number density and
	Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations in different
	subsamples: at high z > 1.5 and low z < 1.5 redshifts and for two
	different choices of QSO in a conservative and in a more speculative
	analysis. We find an overall evidence for a cross-correlation different
	from zero at the 2.7 sigma level, while this evidence drops to 1.5
	sigma at z > 1.5. We focus on the capabilities of the ISW to constrain
	the behaviour of the dark energy component at high redshift both
	in the Lambda CDM and Early Dark Energy cosmologies, when the dark
	energy is substantially unconstrained by observations. At present,
	the inclusion of the ISW data results in a poor improvement compared
	to the obtained constraints from other cosmological datasets. We
	study the capabilities of future high-redshift QSO survey and find
	that the ISW signal can improve the constraints on the most important
	cosmological parameters derived from Planck CMB data, including the
	high redshift dark energy abundance, by a factor ~ 1.5.},

	Abstract = {This review is focused on tests of Einstein's theory of General Relativity
	with gravitational waves that are detectable by ground-based interferometers
	and pulsar timing experiments. Einstein's theory has been greatly
	constrained in the quasi-linear, quasi-stationary regime, where gravity
	is weak and velocities are small. Gravitational waves will allow
	us to probe a complimentary, yet previously unexplored regime: the
	non-linear and dynamical strong-field regime. Such a regime is, for
	example, applicable to compact binaries coalescing, where characteristic
	velocities can reach fifty percent the speed of light and compactnesses
	can reach a half. This review begins with the theoretical basis and
	the predicted gravitational wave observables of modified gravity
	theories. The review continues with a brief description of the detectors,
	including both gravitational wave interferometers and pulsar timing
	arrays, leading to a discussion of the data analysis formalism that
	is applicable for such tests. The review ends with a discussion of
	gravitational wave tests for compact binary systems.},

@article{zaldarriaga:1997,
	Abstract = {Using the formalism of spin-weighted functions we present an all-sky
	analysis of polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
	Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor,
	which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin +/-2 spherical harmonics.
	These are the analogues of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature
	maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations.
	We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin +/-2 multipole
	moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize
	the statistical properties of polarization in the CMB. Magnetic-type
	parity combination does not receive contributions from scalar modes
	and does not cross correlate with either temperature or electric-type
	parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that
	fully characterize statistical properties of CMB. We present their
	explicit expressions for scalar and tensor modes in the form of line
	of sight integral solution and numerically evaluate them for a representative
	set of models. These general solutions differ from the expressions
	obtained previously in the small scale limit both for scalar and
	tensor modes. A method to generate and analyze all-sky maps of temperature
	and polarization is given and the optimal estimators for various
	power spectra and their corresponding variances are discussed.},
